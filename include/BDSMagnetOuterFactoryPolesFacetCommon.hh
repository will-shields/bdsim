/**
 * @brief Factory class for outer volume of magnets. 
 *
 * Produces magnets
 * with 2N-poles around the beampipe with a faceted yoke - the yoke 
 * is perpendiular to the pole direction where the pole joins the yoke.
 * 
 * Most magnets are 2N poles, but sector- and r-bends as well as 
 * muon spoilers, and h/v kickers are unique.
 *
 * This class provides the common code for 'facet' and 'facetcrop'
 * styles as there's only one number different in the yoke code.
