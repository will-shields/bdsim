/**
 * @brief 4D array and base class for 3,2 & 1D arrays. 
 * 
 * Data represents T,Z,Y,X dimensions. The data is stored 
 * as a (1D) vector and stored in that order. This means that
 * adjacent X values are stored next to each other. Storing the data
 * as a 1D vector improves performance for random access (through
 * behind the scenes caching) and significantly improves performance 
 * for copying.
 * 
 * Data can be accessed by index only in the array.  Testing of indices
 * is provided.
 *
 * The () operator is used for accessing and setting as the [] operator
 * can only ever accept one parameter by design.
 * https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/operator-overloading#matrix-subscript-op
 * 
 * The size cannot be changed after construction.
