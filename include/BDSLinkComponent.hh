/**
 * @brief A BDSAcceleratorComponent wrapper for BDSLinkOpaqueBox.
 * 
 * This is similar to BDSSimpleComponent but specialised for a link
 * box containing a component. This is to allow it to be used in a beam line.
 *
 * Note, the lengths reported for this are for the full thing and not the component
 * inside as this is required to comply with beam line building mechanics.
