/**
 * @brief Common interface for any primary generators that are file based.
 *
 * Any derived class must implement G4VPrimaryGeneratorAction::GeneratePrimaryVertex(event).
 * In this, it must update the protected members in this class of endOfFileReached and
 * vertexGeneratedSuccessfully.
 *
 * Matching the file length is done externally but by using the DistributionIsFinished() method
 * in this class. Whether looping is permitted is known about in this class.
