/**
 * @brief Class that constructs a Geant4 model of an accelerator.
 *
 * Mandatory class that must be supplied for a valid Geant4 simulation.
 * As construction is based on user input (via the parser) for a potentially
 * large number of items, the construction process is factorised into key steps
 * with member functions and makes use of factories for components and tunnel segments.
 * 
 * Maintained by Laurie Nevay & Jochem Snuverink
