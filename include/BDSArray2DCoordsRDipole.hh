/**
 * @brief A wrapper to achieve 2D reflection of a minimal dipole field solve.
 * 
 * This allows a smaller array representing the positive quadrant in x,y to 
 * be reflected to represent a quadrupole.
 *
 * \verbatim
 *       y
 *       ∧
 *       |
 *    ∧  |  ∧
 *    |  |  | original
 * <---  |  --->
 *       |
 * -------------------> x
 * ∧     |     ∧
 * |     |     |
 * --->  |  <---
 *       |
 *       |
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * This owns the array it wraps.
 *
 * This makes an array look 4 times bigger than it is - ie 2x as big in x and y. The
 * array coordinates are correspondingly shifted. What would've been (0,0) in a 100x100
 * array will now be at index (101,101).
 *
 * This is reflected about 0,0 and can only be so given the implementation.
 *
 * Some interfaces are overloaded and some aren't as are required to be (NX for example).
 * The ostream << writes both the raw array and the reflected version too.
 *
 * Note, by return a reference to a non-const member returnValue that may be updated by another
 * query, thread safety could be an issue.
 *
