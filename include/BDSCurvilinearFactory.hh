/**
 * @brief Factory to create curvilinear geometry for parallel world.
 * 
 * Creates cylinders for straight or angled sections that can be used
 * in a parallel world (only!) for curvilinear coordinates. These have
 * logical volumes with nullptr for material, so can therefore only be
 * used in a parallel world.
 * 
 * The length supplied should be the full length desired. The length of the
 * object returned will be this length - 2x length safety.
