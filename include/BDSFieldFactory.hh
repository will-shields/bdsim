/**
 * @brief Factory that produces fields and their associated objects.
 * 
 * Field objects are created according to a BDSFieldType and the associated
 * and required Geant4 objects to properly implement a field. These are packaged
 * together in one object. This factory does not own any of its products. Construction
 * follows in this order:
 *
 * 1 field
 * 2 equation of motion (based on field object)
 * 3 integrator
 * 4 chord finder
 * 5 field manager
 * 6 package it up
 *
 * This also makes use of BDSParser singleton class to create a series of BDSFieldInfo 
 * field specfications as defined by the parser.
