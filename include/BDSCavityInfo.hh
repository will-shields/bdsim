/**
 * @brief Holder for all Geometrical information required to create an RF cavity. 
 * 
 * Geant4 units are assumed by classes that use instances of this class.
 * This reduces the number of argument to constructors 
 * plus aggregates common tasks in the component factory.
 *
 * Note, compiler provided copy constructor is sufficient as only pointers
 * to materials owned by BDSMaterials are kept - shallow copy is required then.
 *
 * This class does not specify the vacuum material as ideally we can specify the
 * the 'vacuum' pressure and composition throughout the machine without redefining
 * a cavity model.
