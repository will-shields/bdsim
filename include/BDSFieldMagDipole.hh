 * @brief A uniform dipole field.
 * 
 * This class represents a uniform dipole field. This may optionally be constructed
 * with a unit vector to denote a different direction. This uses the parameters
 * "angle" and "length" (the magnetic field length) from the input 
 * BDSMagnetStrength instance. MADX uses angle rather than k0, so we follow that
 * convention.
