/**
 * @brief Abstract base class that implements features common to all magnets. 
 *
 * Magnet consists of a beam pipe (with optional field) and an 'outer' (with
 * optional field) both placed in the same level in a container volume. The
 * outer is typically a yoke but can be any geometry as long as it doesn't
 * overlap with the beam pipe placed at the same level.
