/**
 * @brief A holder for any placement offsets and rotations for a BDSAcceleratorComponent.
 * 
 * Note, no rotation variables are provided other than along the beam
 * axis (z) as this would cause overlapping volumes between a component
 * and the next one in the line.  This leads to much more complicated 
 * geometry or padding space (perhaps acceptable for very low angles), 
 * but for now is left to be implemented in future.
