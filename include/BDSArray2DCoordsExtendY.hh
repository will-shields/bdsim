/**
 * @brief A wrapper to extend the data about the y axis maintaining field direction.
 *
 * This owns the array it wraps.
 * 
 * \verbatim
 *       y
 *       ∧
 *       |
 * ∧     |  ∧
 * |     |  |
 * --->  |  --->
 *       |
 *       |
 * \endverbatim
 * 
 * This makes an array look 2 times bigger than it is - ie 2x as big in x. The
 * array coordinates are correspondingly shifted. What would've been (0,0) in a 100x100
 * array will now be at index (101,0).
 *
 * Some interfaces are overloaded and some aren't as are required to be (sizeX for example).
 * The ostream << writes both the raw array and the reflected version too.
 *
 * Note, by return a reference to a non-const member returnValue that may be updated by another
 * query, thread safety could be an issue.
