 * @brief Generates BDSHitsEnergyDepositions from step information - uses curvilinear coords.

 * This class interrogates a G4Step and generates an energy deposition hit if there was
 * a change in energy. This assigns the energy deposition to a point randomly (uniformly)
 * along the step.  It also uses a BDSAuxiliaryNavigator instance to use transforms from
 * the curvilinear parallel world for curvilinear coordinates.
