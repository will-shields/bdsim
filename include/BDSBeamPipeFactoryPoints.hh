/**
 * @brief Factory for beam pipes defined by a series of x,y points that
 * are extruded.
 * 
 * This is a pure virtual class that provides common functionality
 * for aperture models derived from a series of points transversely.
 * The derived class need therefore only generate the vector of points
 * that will make the edges of the vacuum and inner & outer beam pipe 
 * surfaces. The solids are of type G4ExtrudedSolid, or in the case of angled 
 * faces, a G4ExtrudedSolid intersected with a G4CutTubs (cylinder with 
 * angled faces).
