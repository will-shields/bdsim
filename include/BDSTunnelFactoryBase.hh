/**
 * @brief Abstract base class for tunnel factory classes
 * 
 * Abstract base class that defines the interface of each factory
 * to build any type of tunnel required. There are four general
 * possibilities apart from the shape (each derived class will give
 * a different cross-section) and these dictate the angled faces.
 * 
 * Uses Geant4 default units by default, ie mm, rad (not metres).
 *
 * NOTE - no derived classes record the 'angle' parameter for 
 * BDSAcceleratorComponent correctly in the BDSTunnelSection instances.
 * This is only acceptable as the tunnel beam line is manually made
 * not using the internal accumulation of coordinates of BDSBeamline.
 * It's also in part necessary as each tunnel segment doesn't obey
 * the no double bending rule of accerlator components so can't be
 * used with angle and arc length accurately.
