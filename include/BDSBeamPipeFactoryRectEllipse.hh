/**
 * @brief Factory for rectellipse aperture model beampipes.
 * 
 * This is the overlap of (boolean AND) a rectangle and an ellipse
 * transversely.  This factory is similar to the simple LHC factory
 * and uses the intersection of an elliptical tube and a box. This
 * method produces a solid shape, so to achieve a pipe, a smaller
 * duplicate intersection solid is made for subtraction from the outer
 * one. To achieve the angled faces, G4CutTubs is used and the rectangular
 * box is made longer so the first intersection gives the angled face
 * from the easier G4CutTubs primitive.
 * 
 * This factory requires four aperture parameters. Aper1,2 are the horizontal
 * and vertical half widths of the rectangle respectively, and aper3,4 are the
 * horizontal and vertical semi-axes of the ellipse. Note, will aper1,2 should be
 * < aper1,2 otherwise an elliptical tube will be more efficient.
