 * @brief A registry of constructed BDSAcceleratorComponent instances that
 * can be searched. 
 * 
 * Uses an std::map rather than unordered map as although 
 * slower to access (less often and only at construction), a map is faster 
 * for iterating than an unordered map, which will be required to apply 
 * wrapper physics processes - relatively common.
