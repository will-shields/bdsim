 * @brief A registry of constructed BDSAcceleratorComponent instances that

 * 
 * Uses an std::map rather than unordered map as although 
 * slower to access (less often and only at construction), a map is faster 
 * for iterating than an unordered map, which will be required to apply 
 * wrapper physics processes - relatively common.
 *
 * NOTE, the iterations of the registry applies only to components that can
 * be reused. The AllAllocatedComponents function should be used to access
 * all components held in memory in the registry.
