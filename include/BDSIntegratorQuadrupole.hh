/**
 * @brief Integrator that ignores the field and uses the analytical solution to a quadrupole.
 * 
 * Analytical solution to a quadrupole field. This integrator will use the analytical solution
 * for a quadrupole (matrix) to transport a particle along a given step length. This will only
 * do so for particles that are considered paraxial. For particles that don't meet this criteria
 * the backupStepper from BDSIntegratorMag is used to integrate through the quadrupolar
 * field. This ensures the integrator functions correctly with particles with large transverse
 * momenta, or even ones that are travelling backwards such as secondaries.
