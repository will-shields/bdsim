/**
 * @brief A simple parameterisation of N-Pole outer yoke magnetic field.
 *
 * Field that roughly approximates the field in a yoke of an n-pole magnet.
 * The field is generated by the linear sum of infinitely long wire current
 * sources along +-z (local) placed at a radius of poleTipRadius according
 * to the order of the magnet. Note, these current sources are placed exactly
 * in between the pole will be for each type of magnet. The field is normalised
 * to the field at the pole tip radius given innerFieldIn.
 * 
 * If a point close (< 6mm) to a pole is queried, the field is capped at the 
 * normalised value at the pole tip - assumed to be the highest value.
 *
 * This field of course does not accurately represent the field in the yoke
 * of a magnet as it neglects the permeability and the geometry, however, it
 * is a 1st order approximation.
 *
 * Does not own or delete the BDSFieldMag* innerFieldIn argument.
