 * @brief Holder for information to calculate per entry histograms.
 *
 * This creates a histogram per event and accumualtes the mean and variance
 * for every bin in a cloned histogram. In the case of 1 event, the bin error
 * is 0. 
 * 
 * This uses a HistogramAccumulator object rather than inheritance as this
 * class has to prepare the base histogram in the constructor first.
