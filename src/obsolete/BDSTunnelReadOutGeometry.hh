/**
 * @brief Class that generates readout geometry for tunnel segments.
 *
 * 
 * A la Geant4, this would actually
 * construct a 'parallel' (not to be confused with the G4ParallelWorld
 * class, which is unrelated) world separately and after the main
 * 'mass' world.  However, this is really quite inconvenient so both
 * are constructed at the same time from the same accelerator components
 * and this is a dummy class required by Geant4 that simply gets the 
 * already constructed world and returns it.
