Supported Systems
=================

BDSIM is developed and used on Mac OSX and Linux.

Tested systems:

* Mac OSX 10.14.3 (Mojave), XCode 10.1, Geant4.10.5, ROOT 6.16/00, CLHEP 2.4.1.0, Qt5.12.0
* Mac OSX 10.13.3 (High Sierra), XCode 10.1, Geant4.10.4.p02, ROOT 6.12/06, CLHEP 2.3.4.4, Qt5.12.0
* SLC6, GCC 4.9.3, Geant4.10.5.0, ROOT 6.10/08, CLHEP 2.3.3.0, Qt5.7.0
* SLC6 as above with Geant4.10.4.p02, Geant4.10.3.p03, Geant4.10.2.p03, Geant4.10.1.p03

Obtaining  BDSIM
================

BDSIM may be obtained either from the BDSIM website or the git repository may be cloned.
The user must compile it on their system and must have Geant4, CLHEP and ROOT
already present (or access to AFS).

Obtaining via the git repository allows easier updates in future as the
user can 'pull' the latest version and then recompile without having to
create a separate copy.

..  _from-git-repository:

From the GIT Repository
-----------------------

To download the source from the git repository, use the command::

  git clone --recursive https://bitbucket.org/jairhul/bdsim

This will create a directory called ``bdsim``, inside which all the code, examples
and documentation is provided. Also, the python utilities that come with BDSIM will be present
when the :code:`--recursive` option is used.

Download
--------

BDSIM versions can be downloaded from the git repository website:

https://bitbucket.org/jairhul/bdsim/downloads/?tab=tags


From Precompiled Sources
------------------------

BDSIM may also be downloaded from precompiled sources. These are available
on: http://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/bdsim/download

.. AFS
   ---

   With AFS connection you can get the latest released BDSIM version from::

   /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/bdsim

   The latest develop version (updated daily) is available under::

   /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/bdsim-develop

   As usual the Geant4 environment script needs to be loaded::

   source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/geant4.10.2-setup.sh

.. _required-packages:
   
Requirements \& Environment
===========================

1) A recent compiler with full C++11 support. Proven compiler versions are GCC 4.9 or higher,
   or clang 6 or higher.
2) `CMake`_ 2.8.12 or higher (Geant4.10.2 onward requires `CMake`_ 3.3 or higher).
3) `CLHEP`_ 2.1.3.1 or higher, see also `CLHEP Installation Guide`_.
4) *Optional* - Python 2.7 series for python utilities and easy data loading with ROOT.
5) `ROOT`_ 6.0 or higher, for output & analysis compiled with python 2.7 support (default is 3 series).
6) *Optional* - Qt5 libraries for best Geant4 visualiser.
7) *Optional* - Xerces-C++ 3.2 XML library for GDML geometry file loading in Geant4.
8) `Geant4`_ installed or access to **AFS** [#macafsnote]_. Version 4.10 or
   higher (latest patch of that release). See `Geant4 Installation Guide`_
9) Flex 2.5.37 or higher.
10) Bison 2.3 or higher.

.. note:: These are listed in the correct order of installation / requirement.

Geant4 and ROOT Versions
------------------------

We have found some problems with certain versions of software and these should be
avoided. Generally, we recommend the latest patch version of Geant4. These are the
problems we have found:

* Geant4.10.3.0  - excessively long overlap checking - 15mins per solid vs 40ms.
* Geant4.10.3.pX - generic biasing has no effect - same code works in every other version.
* Geant4.10.4.0  - crash within constructor of G4ExtrudedSolid used extensivly in BDSIM.
* Geant4.10.5.0  - the cashkarp integrator for fields will always crash.

.. _mac-osx-issues:
  
Mac OS X Issues
---------------
  
* Mac OSX Mojave - OpenGL visualisations in Geant4 appear to be missing in a grey
  screen or worse, bits of the interface double size. The user must use Qt 5.12.1
  or greater for these issues to be resolved. This issue is documented here:
  https://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=2104

Geant4 Environment
------------------

Note: even though installed, the Geant4 environmental variables must be
available. You can test this in a terminal with::

  > echo $G4 <tab>
  $G4ABLADATA         $G4NEUTRONHPDATA    $G4RADIOACTIVEDATA
  $G4LEDATA           $G4NEUTRONXSDATA    $G4REALSURFACEDATA
  $G4LEVELGAMMADATA   $G4PIIDATA          $G4SAIDXSDATA

If these do not exist, please source the Geant4 environmental script
before installing BDSIM and each time before using BDSIM. It is common
to add this to your ``.bashrc`` or profile so that it's loaded automatically
every time::

  source path/to/geant4/installation/bin/geant4.sh


Setting Up
==========

The following sections detail the setup process for different operating systems.

- `Mac OSX`_
- `Linux`_

.. - `Linux with AFS Access`_

Mac OSX
-------

We recommend obtaining :ref:`required-packages` using the `MacPorts`_ package manager,
although they can be obtained both through other package managers and by
manually downloading, compiling and installing the source for each.

After this, `Building`_ can be started.

.. warning:: For Mac OSX Mojave, see :ref:`mac-osx-issues`.

Linux
-----

Install the :ref:`required-packages` preferably with a
package manager.

Older versions of Geant4 can be downloaded from their
`archive <http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/source_archive.shtml>`_ .
For Scientific Linux 6 or modern Linux versions, we recommend the latest version of Geant4 (currently 4.10.2).
Note: the required compiler version (GCC 4.9) is more modern than the default one (GCC 4.4) on SL6. You
can check the compiler version with::

  gcc --version

With AFS access version 4.9 can be found here::

  source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.9/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/setup.sh

After this, `Building`_ can be started.

.. Linux with AFS Access
   ---------------------

   When the machine has AFS connection, the latest stable release binary is available::

   /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/bdsim

   Before using the binary you must source the Geant4 setup::

   source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/geant4.10-setup.sh

   When compiling BDSIM from source, the dependent packages like Geant4 can
   be taken from AFS and don't need to be compiled and installed locally. The same
   compiler version needs to be used for BDSIM as the one that was used for Geant4.
   The following scripts must be sourced before using CMake.

   For the versions 0.61 and onward::

   source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/gcc49-setup.sh
   source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/geant4.10-setup.sh

   For version 0.6 and older::

   source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/gcc46-setup.sh
   source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/geant4.9.6-setup.sh

   If compiling independently, GCC 4.9 can be found with::

   source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.9/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/setup.sh

   but this must be sourced before using the software once compiled.

   After this, `Building`_ can be started.

.. _installation-building:
   
Building
--------

Once ready, make a directory **outside** the BDSIM source directory to build
BDSIM in::

  > ls
  bdsim
  > mkdir bdsim-build
  > ls
  bdsim bdsim-build

It is important that the build directory be outside the source directory, otherwise
trouble may be encountered when receiving further updates from the git repository.
From this directory use the following CMake command to configure the BDSIM
installation::

  > cd bdsim-build
  > cmake ../bdsim

This typically produces the following output, which is slightly different on each computer::

CMake will search your system for the required dependencies. In the above example, this
proceeded without any errors. In the case where a required dependency cannot be found,
an error will be shown and CMake will stop. Please see `Configuring the BDSIM Build with
CMake`_ for further details on how to fix this and further configure the BDSIM installation.

You can then compile BDSIM with::

  > make

BDSIM can then be installed (default directory /usr/local) for access from anywhere
on the system with::

  > sudo make install

To change the installation directory, see `Configuring the BDSIM Build with CMake`_.
From any directory on your computer, ``bdsim`` should be available.

At this point, BDSIM itself will work, but more environmental variables must be
set to use the analysis tools (this is a requirement of ROOT). These can be set
by sourcing the bdsim.sh shell script in the installation directory: ::

  source <bdsim-install-dir>/bin/bdsim.sh

This can be added to your :code:`.profile` or :code:`.bashrc` file. The user
should adapt this if they use a C-shell.

* Re-source your profile (or restart the terminal).
* You should be able to execute :code:`bdsim --help` or :code:`rebdsim`

.. figure:: figures/rebdsim_execution.png
	    :width: 100%
	    :align: center

If the analysis will be regularly used interactively, it is worth automating the library
loading in root by finding and editing the :code:`rootlogon.C` in your
:code:`<root-install-dir>/macros/` directory.  Example text would be::

  cout << "Loading rebdsim libraries" << endl;
  gSystem->Load("librebdsimLib");
  gSystem->Load("libbdsimRootEvent");

.. note:: The file extension is omitted on purpose.

The absolute path is not necessary, as the above environmental variables are used by ROOT
to find the library.

From the build directory you can verify your installation using a series of tests
included with BDSIM (excluding long running tests)::

  > ctest -LE LONG

.. _installation-environmental-variables:
  
Environmental Variables
***********************

These variables are required by ROOT to access the BDSIM classes and not by BDSIM itself.
These variables are set in the :code:`<bdsim-install-dir>/bin/bdsim.sh` provided shell script,
but are also described here manually. ::

   export BDSIM=<bdsim-install-dir>
   export PATH=$PATH:$BDSIM/bin
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BDSIM/lib (Linux only)
   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BDSIM/lib (mac only)
   export ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH=$BDSIM/include/bdsim/:$BDSIM/include/bdsim/analysis/:$BDSIM/include/bdsim/parser 

These can of course be manually added to your :code:`.profile` or :code:`.bashrc` file.
   

.. _setup-python-utilities:
  
Python Utilities
----------------

* Quick setup: simply run ``make`` from the ``bdsim/utils`` directory.
  
BDSIM includes copies of our accompanying Python utilities (pytransport, pymad8, pymadx
and pybdsim) that can now be installed. These all exist in separate git repositories in
the following locations:

* https://bitbucket.org/jairhul/pybdsim
* https://bitbucket.org/jairhul/pymadx
* https://bitbucket.org/jairhul/pymad8
* https://bitbucket.org/jairhul/pytransport

These can all be set up separately, or alternatively the user can install all at
once with the MakeFile added for convenience (running make command).  The Python package
installer ("PIP") is required for this.

.. note:: ROOT should be compiled with Python2.7 support for the full functionality of
	  pybdsim data loading to be exploited.

To set up all utilities at once:

.. code::

   cd bdsim/utils
   make

The utilities should now be available through Python::

  >>> import pybdsim
  >>> import pymadx
  >>> import pymad8
  >>> import pytransport

.. note:: If it's required to edit these utilities, please do not edit the copy in bdsim/utils,
	  as this will cause problems with git and pulling changes. It is strongly recommended
	  to clone each utility separately outside the BDSIM source directory and edit that version,
	  leaving the included one untouched.

.. _configuring-bdsim:

Configuring the BDSIM Build with CMake
--------------------------------------

To either enter paths to dependencies manually, or edit the configuration, the following
command will give you and interface to CMake (from ``bdsim-build`` directory)::

  > ccmake .

.. image:: figures/cmake_screenshot.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

You can then use **up** and **down** arrows to select the desired parameter and
**enter** to edit it. If the parameter is a path, press **enter** again after
entering the path to confirm.

Once the parameter has been edited, you can proceed by pressing **c** to run
the configuration and if successful, follow this by **g** to generate the
build. After configuring the installation, you should run::

  > make
  > sudo make install

Note, ``sudo`` is used here as the default installation directory will be a
system folder. You can however, specify a different directory in the above **ccmake**
configuration and that won't require the ``sudo`` command. The installation directory
can be specified by editing the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.

Making the Manual
-----------------

The manual is available online at http://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/bdsim/manual and included
as a pdf in the source directory, but if desired the user can compile the manual
in both HTML and pdflatex from the build directory using the following command
to make the HTML manual in the folder ``manual/html``::

  > make manual

 Similarly::

  > make manual-pdf

will make the pdf Manual in the folder ``manual/latex``.

.. note:: This requires the sphinx documentation system to be installed and all utility
	  python packages to be available in python from any directory. The latexpdf build
	  requires a full installation of pdflatex to be available as well.


Making Doxygen Code Documentation
---------------------------------

Doxygen code documentation is available online at
http://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/bdsim/doxygen/

If desired the user can create this from the build directory using the following command
to make the Doxygen documentation in a folder called ``Doxygen``.::

  > make doc

.. note:: This requires the Doxygen documentation system to be installed.

CLHEP Installation Guide
------------------------

If not installed with a package manager, download `CLHEP-2.3.1.1`_ or a newer version from the `CLHEP`_ website.

Move and unpack to a suitable place::

   > tar -xzf clhep-2.3.1.1.tgz
   > cd 2.3.1.1

Make build directory::

   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   > cmake ../CLHEP

Adapt parameters if needed with::

   > ccmake .

Make and install::

   > make
   > sudo make install

.. _geant4-installation-guide:

Geant4 Installation Guide
-------------------------

BDSIM builds with most recent versions of Geant4 (version 4.10 onwards). You can usually
get Geant4 through a package manager such as MacPorts or Brew, but often a manual installation
is more flexible to allow choice of visualiser and use of GDML (necessary for external
geometry). For manual installation, download the latest patch version 4.10.2 from the
Geant website. Move and unpack to a suitable place ::

  > tar -xzf geant4.10.5.tar.gz
  > ls
  geant4.10.5

Make a build and installation directory **outside** that directory ::

  > mkdir geant4.10.5-build
  > mkdir geant4.10.5-install

Configure Geant4 using CMake ::

  > cd geant4.10.5-build
  > cmake ../geant4.10.5

At this point it's useful to define the installation directory for Geant4 by
modifying the CMake configuration as generally described in
`Configuring the BDSIM Build with CMake`_. ::

  > ccmake .

It is useful to change a few options with Geant4 for practical purposes.

.. figure:: figures/geant4options.png
	    :width: 90%
	    :align: center

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{7cm}|p{8cm}|

+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Option**                      | **Description**                                             |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX**        | Useful to specify a known folder to install to.             |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_BUILD_CXXSTD**         | 14 - For ROOT version 6 (and gcc compiler).                 |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED**  | OFF - BDSIM does not support this yet.                      |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_INSTALL_DATA**         | ON - otherwise Geant will try to download data dynamically, |
|                                 | as it's required during the simulation and it may not be    |
|                                 | possible to run offline.                                    |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR**      | Useful to specify to a known folder you make. Typically     |
|                                 | any  **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX** / data.                       |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_USE_GDML**             | ON - for external geometry import.                          |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11**       | ON - basic visualiser.                                      |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_USE_QT**               | ON - the best and most interactive visualiser.              |
|                                 | Needs Qt to be installed                                    |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_CLHEP**     | ON - must be on so both Geant4 and BDSIM use the same CLHEP |
|                                 | library. Therefore, there's only one random number          |
|                                 | generator and simulations have strong reproducibility.      |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB**      | OFF - easier if we use the Geant4 internal version.         |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11**    | ON - The most accurate visualiser, but relatively slow and  |
|                                 | not interactive. Useful for promotional materials.          |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **GEANT4_USE_XM**               | ON - similar to Qt and the one to use if Qt isn't           |
|                                 | available. Needs motif to be installed.                     |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

.. warning:: Make sure **GEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED** is off since this is currently not supported.

.. note:: The CLHEP option is required.  The GDML and QT options are strongly recommended. Others
	  are to the user's preference.

Once the installation directory is set, press ``c`` to run the configuration
process, and when complete, press ``g`` to generate the build. If ``g`` is not an
available option, then continue to press ``c`` until it becomes available. This
typically takes two or three times - it is due to dependencies being dependent on
other dependencies. Geant4 can then
be compiled ::

  > make

Note: Geant4 can take around 20 minutes to compile on a typical computer. If your
computer has multiple cores, you can significantly decrease the time required to
compile by using extra cores ::

  > make -jN

where ``N`` is the number of cores on your computer [#ncoresnote]_. Geant4 should
then be installed ::

  > make install

Note: if you've specified the directory to install, you will not need the ``sudo``
command. However, if you've left the settings as default, it'll be installed
in a folder that requires ``sudo`` permissions such as ``/usr/local/``.

**IMPORTANT** - you should source the Geant4 environment each time before running
BDSIM, as this is required for the physics models of Geant4.  This can be done using ::

  > source path/to/geant4.10.5-install/bin/geant4.sh

It may be useful to add this command to your ``.bashrc`` or profile script.

Upgrading BDSIM
===============

To update BDSIM when a new release is made, we recommend receiving updates through the
git repository. To receive the latest version of the software, the user must 'pull' the
changes from the git repository and then update the build.

.. note::  Assuming you have a BDSIM source directory ("bdsim") that is a clone of the git repository
  and a separate build directory ("bdsim-build") that is *outside* the source directory.

.. code::

   cd bdsim
   git pull
   git submodule update

You then have two options: 1) make a clean build or 2) update the current build. The first option
is generally more robust and we recommend that. Both are described for completeness.

Clean Build
-----------

.. code::
   
   cd ../bdsim-build
   rm -rf *
   cmake ../bdsim
   make -j4
   make install

If custom locations for various dependencies had to be specified with CMake for the initial
configuration and compilation of BDSIM, these will have to be repeated (see
:ref:`configuring-bdsim` for details on using ccmake to do this).

Updated Existing Build
----------------------

.. code::

   cd ../bdsim-build
   cmake ../bdsim
   make -j4
   make install

     VRML1FILE (VRML1FILE)
     VRML2FILE (VRML2FILE)
     gMocrenFile (gMocrenFile)

   If your favourite is not there check that Geant4 is correctly compiled with that graphics system.
   You will have to reconfigure Geant4 and install any necessary libraries (such as Qt or XMotif), then
   recompile Geant4, then recompile bdsim.

2) Error from OpenGL::

     G4OpenGLImmediateX::CreateViewer: error flagged by negative view id in
     G4OpenGLImmediateXViewer creation.

   Check that your graphics card driver is installed correctly for your memory card
   and possibly reinstall them. For Ubuntu for example, run::

     fglrxinfo

   If fglrx is installed and working well you should see an output similar to::

     > fglrxinfo
     display: :0  screen: 0
     OpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
     OpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series
     OpenGL version string: 3.3.11399 Compatibility Profile Context

   For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD

3) Build does not work - GLIBCXX errors, where a message similar to this is shown ::

     Linking CXX executable bdsim
     /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/geant4/9.6.p02/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt
     /lib64/libG4analysis.so: undefined reference to
     'std::__detail::_List_node_base::_M_unhook()@GLIBCXX_3.4.15'

   This means that the compiler version for BDSIM is different from the one used to compile Geant4.
   Make sure it is the same compiler version. Remember to start from a clean build directory, otherwise
   CMake does **NOT** update the compiler version.

4) Build does not work - linker errors with xml and zlib like ::

     /usr/lib/../lib64/libxml2.so: undefined reference to `gzdirect@ZLIB_1.2.2.3'
     collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

   This probably means that the xml library is not properly installed. The easiest option may be not to use this part of BDSIM by switching off the CMake variable USE_LCDD (in ccmake).

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#macafsnote] Note: the use of **AFS** with the Mac OSX build of BDSIM is not supported,
		 as there is no compatible version of Geant4 available on AFS.

.. [#ncoresnote] If your computer supports hyper-threading, you can use twice the number of
		 cores with the ``make -jN`` command (i.e. a computer has 4 cores and supports
		 hyper-threading, can support up to ``make -j8``). Exceeding this number will
		 result in slower than normal compilation.
