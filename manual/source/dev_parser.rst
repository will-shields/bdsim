Parser
******

The parser for the GMAD language is independent from the rest of BDSIM,
and can be found in the parser directory.
The main parser interface can be found in :code:`parser.h`.  The parser is currently a
singleton (only one instance with global scope).

The GMAD language is a LALR (Look-Ahead LR) parser language generated by Bison (in the file :code:`parser.y`) with a lexical analyser generated by flex (from :code:`parser.l`). GMAD provides basic arithmetic and boolean operators. GMAD also provides predefined units, constants in SI units and some common mathematical functions, like the trigonometric ones, by binding them to actual C variables and functions.

GMAD is designed to be an extension of the syntax used by MAD, any MAD syntax should be supported.

Parser classes
==============

All options for a BDSIM run are contained in an instance of Options class.
This is passed to BDSIM.
The Options class is built out of a struct-like OptionsBase
and a layer of self-inspection provided by the Published class.

All other parser classes like Element, Region, etc. also have this layer of self-inspection.

The Parameter class is a temporary storage class of the parameters before the actual Elements are created.

Bison
=====

Bison tokens are from a union and this can be one of the following types:

 * double
 * int (for the enum class ElementType)
 * std::string*
 * GMAD::Array*
 * GMAD::Symtab* (a pointer to a general symbol class, which can represent a double, string, GMAD::Array or a function)

The tokens themselves are defined at the top of :code:`parser.y`

Since adding or changing Bison rules can often have unforseen consequences, 
it is strongly recommended that when extending the GMAD language to first write a test case for it and check that it fails.
Often the compiler will complain when the rules are inconsistent
and the CMake tests cover many syntax cases which all should still work.
For debugging there are several options in :code:`parser.y`, all of which need recompilation:

 * The variables ECHO_GRAMMAR and INTERACTIVE can be switched on for extra output
 * Compile Bison with "-t" flag. This is automatically done when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE equals Debug
 * Uncomment the line with %debug. This will print out the token stack after each step.
