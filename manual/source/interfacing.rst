Interfacing
***********

As BDSIM is completely open source, it is possible to extend BDSIM or interface it with
other software. This ability is driven by the needs of users, so we strongly encourage
users or would-be developers to get in touch with the developers (see :ref:`support-section`).
We welcome extensions and contributions to BDSIM.

Below are details of various methods to extend BDSIM.

Compiling Against BDSIM
=======================

BDSIM includes CMake files in the installation so that another CMake application can
use the BDSIM classes and libraries. CMake is a system to automatically create
Make files for different operating systems and different computer systems with libraries
in various locations. CMake is used as the build system for BDSIM, but also for Geant4,
ROOT and CLHEP and is a common C++ software paradigm. Below is the most minimal CMakeLists.txt
to create a C++ application using BDSIM.::

  cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.2)
  project (externalcpp)

  # point cmake to my own custom installation directory that's not a system dir
  # this is where BDSIMConfig.cmake exists
  set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH /Users/nevay/physics/reps/bdsim-develop-install/lib/cmake/bdsim)
  
  # find the package and set up variables
  find_package(BDSIM REQUIRED)
  
  # define program includes
  include_directories(${BDSIM_INCLUDE_DIR}/bdsim)
  
  # make a program and link to gmad (parser) and bdsim libraries
  add_executable(customprogram customprogram.cc)
  target_link_libraries (customprogram gmad bdsim)

Along with this is a single C++ file called customprogram.cc. Below are the contents of this::

  #include "BDSIMClass.hh"

  #include <iostream>

  int main(int argc, char** argv)
  {
    BDSIM* bds = new BDSIM(argc, argv);
    if (!bds->Initialised())
      {std::cout << "Intialisation failed" << std::endl; return 1;}

    std::cout << "Custom stuff here" << std::endl;
  
    bds->BeamOn();
    delete bds;
    return 0;
  }

This example is provided in :code:`bdsim/examples/features/interfaces/externalcpp`. The user
should edit the CMakeLists.txt so that :code:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` points to their BDSIM
installation directory if not in a system directory to allow CMake to find that installation.
  
Custom Beam Line Component
==========================

.. warning:: If there are any geometrical overlaps (broken hierarchy, touching
	     solids, overlapping separate solids at the same level of hierarchy),
	     the Geant4 tracking may be wrong and the results cannot be trusted.
	     This may lead to slow running models, inaccurate results, excessive
	     navigation warnings, or worst of all: no warnings but inaccurate results.
	     When developing custom geometry, the developer **must** ensure no
	     geometrical overlaps are present before the model is used for a physics
	     study.

Whilst BDSIM provides the most common accelerator beam line components, we cannot foresee
custom components that various accelerators may have. To insert a custom component, we
would recommend using a geometry package such as `pyg4ometry` to prepare GDML geometry
and using a generic beam line `element`. See :ref:`python-geometry-preparation` and
the generic beam line element object, :ref:`element`. A field map can also be
overlaid on this.

However, if the user is familiar with Geant4 C++, Geant4 geometry or requires a
more detailed interaction with the simulation, it is possible to add a custom
C++ beam line component to BDSIM. The user must define:

* A class that constructs the beam line component and that inherits BDSAcceleratorComponent.
* A factory class that constructs an instance of the component. This should inherit
  BDSComponentConstructor and translates information provided by BDSIM from the parsing of
  the input text files.
* A C++ main program that uses BDSIM and will be executed like BDSIM.
* A CMake file to compile the application sources.

A complete example is provided in :code:`bdsim/examples/features/interfaces/usercomponent` that
is described here. The contents of the directory are shown below.

This example builds a custom vertical dipole spectrometer. This makes use of the magnet
geometry and beam pipe factories to build a magnet with custom proportions and an offset
beam pipe with a screen inside it.

Input GMAD
----------

The key part in the input GMAD is to define a `usercomponent` beam line element. This takes
and argument `userTypeName` to define the *type* of the element if more than one user
component is regisered. This beam line element can now be used normally in any line
in BDSIM. To convey parameters to the new user-defined element, any parameter available
for any other element may be used. These are defined in :code:`parser/element.hh`. Additional
parameters may be supplied via the element member string "userParameters". This should
be a string with space delimeted parameter value sets where each parameter and value are
separated by a colon. For example::

  userParameters="variable1:0.4 variable2:bananas"

The utility function :code:`BDS::GetUserParametersMap` from
:code:`#include "BDSUtilities.hh"` will split
this up into a map of strings to strings such as:

+-----------------+--------------+
| **Map Key**     | **Value**    |
+=================+==============+
| "variable1"     | "0.4"        |
+-----------------+--------------+
| "variable2"     | "bananas"    |
+-----------------+--------------+

The variables are left as strings and it is up to the developer to know which variables
to convert to numbers if required. The map can also be searched if some variables are
optional. The usercomponent example shows this for passing the colour into the new element.

Component Class
---------------

The component class in this example is called "UDipole". The user component can have any
constructor it likes, but it must inherit BDSAcceleratorComponent and provide a name,
length, angle it bends the beam line by and a string saying the name of the component.
This information is used to construct the beam line and is passed to the output.

.. note:: The "length" is the arc length if there is a finite angle. If there is a finite
	  angle, this is assumed to bend the beam line continuously throughout the component.
	  e.g. no 'S' shaped component. The coordinate system is right-handed and a
	  positive angle causes deflection to negative x coordinate while propagating in
	  the direction z.

BDSIM makes extensive use of the concept of factories. These are bits of code that
take a recipe class - a small class or struct with some simple parameters - and builds
an object. The factory retains no ownership of the object and forgets about it. We use
this pattern to create beam pipes and magnets for example and these can be placed
inside each other or along side each other safely.

Each object inherits BDSGeometryComponent and this deals with the memory management
(ownership) of objects and the extent of the object.

Component Constructor
---------------------

This is a class the user must implement that inherits BDSComponentConstructor. The user
must implement a method called Construct that has pointers to the beam line element
from the parser (GMAD::Element) as well as the ones before and after it. It should
also make sure to change into Geant4 units from the parser's SI units.

Class Documentation
-------------------

BDSIM uses Doxygen for class documentation. This is a series of comments in C++ with
extra comment characters that are built into a documentation system. Please look through
the Doxygen website for BDSIM `<http://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/bdsim/doxygen>`_ or the headers
of the source code in :code:`bdsim/include/*.hh`.
