Model Description
-----------------

This section of the manual had grown too large and has now been split
into smaller sections to more easily find the right information. This
page is here in case someone had a bookmark.

Model description is now in the following sections:

* :ref:`input-syntax` - The general form of the syntax accepted in input files.

* :ref:`model-construction` - Definition of elements in BDSIM.
  
* :ref:`model-control` - Control over physics, options and beams as well as basic sampler output.

* :ref:`model-customisation` - More advanced customisation of a model, including externally
  provided geometry, fields, geometry customisation and tunnels.
