Lattice Description
-------------------

A model of the accelerator is given to BDSIM via input text files in the :ref:`gmad-syntax`.
The overall program structure should follow:

1) Component definition (see :ref:`lattice-elements`)
2) Sequence definition using defined components (see :ref:`lattice-sequence`)
3) Which sequence to use (see :ref:`the-use-command`)
4) Where to record output (see :ref:`sampler-output`)
5) Options, including which physics lists, number to simulate etc. (see :ref:`bdsim-options`)
6) A beam definition (see :ref:`beam-parameters`)

These are described in the following sections. Aside from these standard parameters, more
detail may be added to the model through:

 * :ref:`magnet-geometry-parameters`.
 * Custom :ref:`field-maps`.
 * Adding :ref:`externally-provided-geometry`.
 * :ref:`offsets-and-tilts`.

.. _gmad-syntax:

GMAD Syntax
-----------

GMAD is a language specifically for BDSIM that is made to be human readable.
The name comes from the design intention of MADX syntax and extensions for Geant4.
While GMAD is very similar to MADX, not all MADX commands are supported.

* S.I. units are used except where explicitly specified
* Variables can be defined using :code:`name = value;` syntax
* Arithmetic expressions can be defined
* Binary operators +, -, \*, /, ^, are valid
* Unary operators +, -, are valid
* Boolean operators <, >, <=, >=, <> (not equal), ==, are valid
* Every expression **must** end with a semi-colon;
* No variable name can begin with a number
* !Comments start with an exclamation mark "!"
* A variable may inherit values (via copy) from another variable using :code:`newvariable : existingvariable;`

.. _mathematical-functions:

^^^^^^^^

Examples::

   x = 1;
   y = 2.5-x;
   z = sin(x) + log(y) - 8e5;
   mat = "copper";


.. _coordinates-and-units:
   
Coordinates & Units
-------------------

In Geant4, global Euclidean coordinates are used for tracking purposes. However,
in describing a lattice with BDSIM, curvilinear coordinates are used, as is common with
accelerators (X,Y,S).

**GMAD uses SI units**

As an example, one can write either :code:`100*eV` or :code:`0.1*keV` to specify an energy value in GMAD.
Both are equivalent.

.. _circular-machines:

Circular Machines
-----------------

To simulate circular machines, BDSIM should be executed with the `-\\-circular` executable option
(see :ref:`executable-options` for all executable options). This installs special beam line
elements called the `teleporter` and `terminator` at the end of the lattice that are described
below.

.. note:: There must be a minimum :math:`0.2 \mu m` gap between the last element and the beginning
	  of the sequence to accommodate these elements. This has a minimal impact on tracking.

Both the terminator and teleporter are invisible and very thin elements that are not normally
shown in the visualiser. These can be visualised by executing BDSIM with the `-\\-vis_debug`
executable option.

The turn number is automatically stored in the energy loss output in the data when the
circular option is used.


Terminator
^^^^^^^^^^

In a Geant4 / BDSIM model, all particles are tracked down to zero energy or until they leave the world
volume. In the case of a circular accelerator, the particles may circulate indefinitely as they lose
no energy traversing the magnetic fields. To control this behaviour and limit the number of turns
taken in the circular machine, the terminator is inserted. This is a very thin disk that has
dynamic limits attached to it. It is normally transparent to all particles and composed of vacuum.
After the desired number of turns of the primary particle has elapsed, it switches to being
an infinite absorber. It achieves this by setting limits (G4UserLimits) with a maximum allowed energy
of 0eV.

The user should set the option `nturns` (default 1) (see :ref:`options-common`). ::

  option, nturns=56;


Teleporter
^^^^^^^^^^

Not all optical models close perfectly in Cartesian coordinates, i.e. the ends don't perfectly
align. Some small offsets may be tolerable, as most tracking codes use curvilinear coordinates.
To account for this, the teleporter is a small disk volume inserted to make up the space
and shift particles transversely as if the ends matched up perfectly. This is automatically
calculated and constructed when using the `-\\-circular` executable option.

Although the teleporter may not be required in a well-formed model that closes, the minimum
gap of :math:`0.2 \mu m` is required for the terminator.


.. _lattice-elements:

Beamline Elements
-----------------

BDSIM provides a variety of different elements each with their own function, geometry and
potential fields. Any element in BDSIM is described with the following pattern::

  name: type, parameter=value, parameter="string";

.. note:: Notice the ':', the inverted commas for a string parameter and that each
	  functional line must end with a semi-colon. Spaces will be ignored.

The following elements may be defined

* `drift`_
* `rbend`_
* `sbend`_
* `quadrupole`_
* `sextupole`_
* `octupole`_
* `decapole`_
* `multipole`_
* `thinmultipole`_
* `vkicker`_
* `hkicker`_
* `kicker`_
* `tkicker`_
* `rf`_
* `rcol`_
* `jcol`_
* `ecol`_
* `degrader`_
* `muspoiler`_
* `shield`_
* `solenoid`_
* `laser`_
* `gap`_
* `crystalcol`_
* `undulator`_
* `transform3d`_
* `element`_
* `marker`_
* `wirescanner`_

.. TODO add screen, awakescreen

These are detailed in the following sections.

Simple example, extend and copy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example::

  d1: drift, l=5*m;

This defines a drift element with name `d1` and a length of 5 metres. The definition can later be changed or extended with::

  d1: l=3*m, aper=0.1*m;

Note the omission of the type `drift`. This will change the length of `d1` to 3 metres and set the aperture size to 10 centimetres.

.. Warning:: This only works for beam line elements and not other objects in GMAD syntax (such as a placement).

An element can also be defined by copying an existing element::

  d2: d1, l=2*m;

Element `d2` is a drift with the properties of `d1` and a length of 2 metres. Note that if `d1` is changed again, `d2` will **not** change.

Magnet Strength Polarity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: BDSIM strictly follows the MADX definition of magnet strength parameter
	  `k` - a **positive** `k` corresponds to **horizontal focussing** for a
	  **positively** charged particle. This therefore indicates a positive `k`
	  corresponds to horizontal defocussing for a negatively charged particle.
	  However, MADX treats all particles as positively charged for tracking purposes.

.. versionadded:: 0.7


		  BDSIM currently treats k absolutely, so to convert a MADX lattice for
		  negatively particles, the MADX k values must be multiplied by -1. The
		  pybdsim converter provides an option called `flipmagnets` for this
		  purpose. This may be revised in future releases depending on changes
		  to MADX.


Component Strength Scaling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of acceleration or energy degradation, the central energy of the beam may
change. However, BDSIM constructs all fields with respect to the rigidity calculated
from the particle species and the `energy` parameter in the beam definition (not `E0`,
but `energy`). To easily scale the strengths, every beam line element has the parameter
`scaling` that enables its strength to be directly scaled.

In the case of a dipole, this scales the field but not the angle (the field may be calculated
from the angle if none is specified). For example::

  beam, particle="e-",
        energy=10*GeV;

  sb1: sbend, l=2.5*m, angle=0.1;
  d1: drift, l=1*m;
  cav1: rf, l=1*m, gradient=50, frequency=0;
  sb2: sbend, l=2.5*m, angle=0.1, scaling=1.005;

  l1: line=(sb1,d1,cav1,d1,sb2,d1);

In this example an rf cavity is used to accelerate the beam by 50 MeV (50 MeV / m for 1 m).
The particle passes through one bend, the cavity and then another. As the second bend is
scaled (by a factor of (10 GeV + 50 MeV) / 10 GeV) = 1.005) a particle starting at (0,0) with
perfect energy will appear at (0,0) after this lattice.

In the case of a quadrupole or other magnet, the scaling is internally applied to the `k1`
or appropriate parameter that is used along with the design rigidity to calculate a field
gradient.

An example is included in `examples/features/components/scaling.gmad`.

.. note:: The user should take care to use this linear scaling parameter wisely- particularly
	  in sub-relativistic regimes. The fields should typically be scaled with momentum and
	  not total energy of the particle.


drift
^^^^^

.. figure:: figures/drift.png
	    :width: 30%

`drift` defines a straight beam pipe with no field.

================  ===================  ==========  =========
Parameter         Description          Default     Required
`l`               Length [m]           0           Yes
`vacuumMaterial`  The vacuum material  vacuum      No
                  to use, can be user

* The `aperture parameters`_ may also be specified.

Examples::

   l203b: drift, l=1*m;
   l204c: drift, l=3*cm, beampipeRadius=10*cm;

rbend
^^^^^

.. figure:: figures/rbend.png
	    :width: 40%
	    :align: right

.. |angleFieldComment| replace:: Either the total bending angle, `angle`, or the magnetic field, `B`, (in Tesla)
				 for the nominal beam energy can be specified.
				 If both are defined the magnet is under or over-powered.

`rbend` defines a rectangular bend magnet. |angleFieldComment|
The faces of the magnet are normal to the chord of the
input and output points. Can be specified using:

1) `angle` only - `B` calculated from the angle and the beam design rigidity.
2) `B` only - the angle is calculated from the beam design rigidity.
3) `angle` & `B`  - physically constructed using the angle, and field strength as `B`.

Pole face rotations can be applied to both the input and output faces of the
magnet, based upon the reference system shown in the figure below. A pure dipole
field is provided in the beam pipe and a more general dipole (as
described by :ref:`yoke-multipole-field`) is provided for the yoke. A
quadrupolar component can be specified using the `k1` parameter that is given by:

.. math::

   k_{1} = \frac{1}{B \rho}\,\frac{dB_{y}}{dx}\,[m^{-2}]

If `k1` is specified, the integrator from the `bdsimmatrix` integrator set is used. This
results in no physical pole face angle being constructed for tracking purposes. The
tracking still includes the pole face effects.

.. note:: See :ref:`bend-tracking-behaviour` for important notes about dipole tracking.

.. figure:: figures/poleface_notation_rbend.pdf
	    :width: 75%
	    :align: center

	    Pole face notation for an rbend.

A few points about rbends:

1) For large angles (> 100 mrad), particles may hit the aperture, as the beam pipe is
   represented by a straight (chord) section and even nominal energy particles
   may hit the aperture, depending on the degree of tracking accuracy specified. In this
   case, consider splitting the `rbend` into multiple ones.
2) The pole face rotation angle is limited to :math:`\pm \pi /4` radians.
3) If a non-zero pole face rotation angle is specified, the element preceding / succeeding
   the rotated magnet face must either be a drift or an rbend with opposite rotation (e.g. an rbend with
   :math:`e2 = 0.1` can be followed by an rbend with :math:`e1 = -0.1`). The preceding / succeeding
   element must be longer than the projected length from the rotation, given by
   :math:`2 \tan(\mathrm{eX})`.
4) Fringe field kicks are applied in a thin fringe field magnet (1 micron thick by default) at the beginning
   or at the end of the rbend. The length of the fringe field element can be
   set by the option `thinElementLength` (see `options`_).
5) In the case of finite `fint` or `fintx` and `hgap`, a fringe field is used even
   if `e1` and `e2` have no angle.
6) The `fintK2` and `fintxK2` parameters are for a second fringe field correction term that are included to
   enable optics comparisons with TRANSPORT. Whilst this term is not available in MAD-X, the default values
   of 0 mean this second fringe field correction will not be applied unless `fintK2` or `fintxK2` are
   explicitly specified as non-zero.
7) The effect of pole face rotations and fringe field kicks can be turned off for all dipoles by setting
   the option `includeFringeFields=0` (see `options`_).
8) The poleface curvature does not construct the curved geometry. The effect is instead applied in the thin
   fringefield magnet.

Examples::

   MRB20: rbend, l=3*m, angle=0.003;
   r1: rbend, l=5.43m, beampipeRadius=10*cm, B=2*Tesla;
   RB04: rbend, l=1.8*m, angle=0.05, e1=0.1, e2=-0.1

sbend
^^^^^

.. figure:: figures/sbend.png
	    :width: 40%
	    :align: right


`sbend` defines a sector bend magnet. |angleFieldComment|
The faces of the magnet are normal to the curvilinear coordinate
system. `sbend` magnets are made of a series of straight segments. Can be specified using:

1) `angle` only - `B` calculated from the angle and the beam design rigidity.
2) `B` only - the angle is calculated from the beam design rigidity.
3) `angle` & `B`  - physically constructed using the angle, and field strength as `B`.

Pole face rotations can be applied to both the input and output faces of the magnet,
based upon the reference system shown in the figure below. A pure dipole field is
provided in the beam pipe and a more general dipole (as described by
:ref:`yoke-multipole-field`) is provided for the yoke. A quadrupolar component can
be specified using the `k1` parameter that is given by:

.. math::

   k_{1} = \frac{1}{B \rho}\,\frac{dB_{y}}{dx}\,[m^{-2}]

If `k1` is specified, the integrator from `bdsimmatrix` integrator set is used. This
results in no physical pole face angle being constructed for tracking purposes. The
tracking still includes the pole face effects.

The `sbend` geometry is constructed as many small straight sections with angled faces. This
makes no effect on tracking, but allows a much higher variety of apertures and magnet
geometry to be used given the Geant4 geometry. The number of segments is computed such
that the maximum tangential error in the aperture is 1 mm.

	    Pole face notation for an sbend.

A few points about sbends:

1) The pole face rotation angle is limited to :math:`\pm \pi /4` radians.
2) If a non-zero pole face rotation angle is specified, the element preceding / succeeding
   the rotated magnet face must either be a drift or an sbend with the opposite rotation
   (e.g. an sbend with :math:`e2 = 0.1` can be followed by an sbend with
   :math:`e1 = -0.1`). The preceding / succeeding element must be longer than
   the projected length from the rotation, given by :math:`2 \tan(\mathrm{eX})`.
3) Fringe field kicks are applied in a thin fringe field magnet (1 micron thick by default) at the beginning
   or at the end of the sbend. The length of the fringe field magnet can be
   set by the option `thinElementLength` (see `options`_).
4) In the case of finite `fint` or `fintx` and `hgap` a fringe field is used even
   if `e1` and `e2` have no angle.
5) The `fintK2` and `fintxK2` parameters are for a second fringe field correction term that are included to
   enable optics comparisons with TRANSPORT. Whilst this term is not available in MAD-X, the default values
   of 0 mean this second fringe field correction will not be applied unless `fintK2` or `fintxK2` are
   explicitly specified as non-zero.
6) The effect of pole face rotations and fringe field kicks can be turned off for all dipoles by setting
   the option `includeFringeFields=0` (see `options`_).
7) The poleface curvature does not construct the curved geometry. The effect is instead applied in the thin
   fringefield magnet.

   s1: sbend, l=14.5*m, angle=0.005, magnetGeometryType="lhcright";

Examples::

   OCTUPOLE1 : multipole, l=0.5*m , knl={ 0,0,1 } , ksl={ 0,0,0 };

thinmultipole
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`thinmultipole` is the same as multipole, but is set to have a default length of 1 micron.
For thin multipoles, the length parameter is not required. The element will appear as a thin length of drift
tube. A thin multipole can be placed next to a bending magnet with finite pole face rotation angles.

Examples::

   THINOCTUPOLE1 : thinmultipole , knl={ 0,0,1 } , ksl={ 0,0,0 };

.. note:: The length of the thin multipole can be changed by setting `thinElementLength` (see `options`_).

vkicker
^^^^^^^

`vkicker` can either be a thin or thick vertical dipole magnet. If specified
with a finite length :code:`l`, it will be constructed as a thick dipole. However, if no length (or
a length of exactly 0 is specified), a thin kicker will be built. In practice, the thin version is
constructed as a 1um slice with only the aperture geometry and no surrounding geometry and is not
visible with the default visualisation settings.

The strength is specified by the parameter :code:`vkick`, which is the fractional momentum kick
in the vertical direction. A positive value corresponds to an increase in :math:`p_y`. In the
case of the thin kicker the position is not affected, whereas with the thick kicker, the position
will change.

The strength may also be specified by the magnetic field :code:`B`. A positive field value corresponds
to an increase in :math:`p_y` for a positively charged particle.

.. warning:: :code:`vkick` will supercede the strength even if :code:`B` is specified. Therefore, the
	     user should specify only :code:`vkick` or :code:`B`.

In the case of a thick kicker, the resulting bending angle is calculated using:

.. math::

   \theta = \sin^{-1}(\,p_x)

The dipole field strength is then calculated with respect to the chord length:

.. math::

   \mathbf{B} = B\rho\, \frac{\theta}{\mathrm{chord\,length}}


* The `aperture parameters`_ may also be specified.
* For a vkicker with a finite length, the `magnet geometry parameters`_ may also be specified.

.. note:: Pole face rotations and fringe fields can be applied to vkickers by supplying the same
      parameters that would be applied to an `rbend`_ or `sbend`_ . If the vkicker is zero length,
      the B field value must be supplied in order to calculate the bending radius which required
      to apply the effects correctly.

      * Fringe field kicks are applied in a thin fringe field magnet (1 micron thick by default) at the
        beginning or at the end of the vkicker. The length of the fringe field element can be set by the
        option `thinElementLength` (see `options`_).
      * For zero length vkickers, the pole face and fringe field kicks are applied in the same thin element
        as the vkick.
      * In the case of finite fint or fintx and hgap, a fringe field is used even if e1 and e2 have no angle.
      * The effect of pole face rotations and fringe field kicks can be turned off for all magnets by setting
        the option `includeFringeFields=0` (see `options`_).
      * No pole face geometry is constructed.


A pure dipole field is provided in the beam pipe and a more general multipole (as
described by :ref:`yoke-multipole-field`) is provided for the yoke.

Examples::

   KX15v: vkicker, vkick=1.3e-5;
   KX17v: vkicker, vkick=-2.4e-2, l=0.5*m;
   KX18v: vkicker, B=0.04*T;


hkicker
^^^^^^^

`hkicker` can either be a thin horizontal kicker or a thick horizontal dipole magnet. If
specified with a finite length :code:`l`, it will be constructed as a dipole. However, if no length (or
a length of exactly 0) is specified, a thin kicker will be built. This is typically a 1um slice
with only the shape of the aperture and no surrounding geometry. It is also typically not
visible with the default visualisation settings.

The strength is specified by the parameter :code:`hkick`, which is the fractional momentum kick
in the vertical direction. A positive value corresponds to an increase in :math:`p_x`. In the
case of the thin kicker the position is not affected, whereas with the thick kicker, the position
will change.

The strength may also be specified by the magnetic field :code:`B`. A positive field value corresponds
to an decrease in :math:`p_x` (note right-handed coordinate frame) for a positively charged particle.

.. warning:: :code:`hkick` will supercede the strength even if :code:`B` is specified. Therefore, the
	     user should specify only :code:`hkick` or :code:`B`.

.. note:: A positive value of `hkick` causes an increase in horizontal momentum, so the particle
	  will bend to the left looking along the beam line, i.e. in positive `x`. This is
	  the opposite of a bend where a positive *angle* causes a deflection in negative
	  `x`.

* The `aperture parameters`_ may also be specified.
* For a hkicker with a finite length, the `magnet geometry parameters`_ may also be specified.

.. note:: Pole face rotations and fringe fields can be applied to hkickers by supplying the same
      parameters that would be applied to an `rbend`_ or `sbend`_ . If the hkicker is zero length,
      the B field value must be supplied in order to calculate the bending radius which required
      to apply the effects correctly.

      * Fringe field kicks are applied in a thin fringe field magnet (1 micron thick by default) at the
        beginning or at the end of the hkicker. The length of the fringe field element can be set by the
        option `thinElementLength` (see `options`_).
      * For zero length hkickers, the pole face and fringe field kicks are applied in the same thin element
        as the hkick.
      * In the case of finite fint or fintx and hgap, a fringe field is used even if e1 and e2 have no angle.
      * The effect of pole face rotations and fringe field kicks can be turned off for all magnets by setting
        the option `includeFringeFields=0` (see `options`_).
      * No pole face geometry is constructed.

A pure dipole field is provided in the beam pipe and a more general multipole (as
described by :ref:`yoke-multipole-field`) is provided for the yoke.

Examples::

   KX17h: hkicker, hkick=0.01;
   KX19h: hkicker, hkick=-1.3e-5, l=0.2*m;
   KX21h: hkicker, B=0.03*T;


kicker
^^^^^^

`kicker` defines a combined horizontal and vertical kicker.  Either both or one of the
parameters `hkick` and `vkick` may be specified. Like the `hkicker` and `vkicker`, this
may also be thin or thick. In the case of the thick kicker, the field is the linear
sum of two independently calculated fields.

.. note:: Pole face rotation and fringe fields kicks are unavailable for plain kickers

Example::

  kick1: kicker, l=0.45*m, hkick=1.23e-4, vkick=0.3e-4;


tkicker
^^^^^^^

BDSIM, like MADX, provides a `tkicker` element. This is an alias in BDSIM for a `kicker`_,
however MADX differentiates the two on the basis of fitting parameters. BDSIM does
not make this distinction. See `kicker`_ for more details.

In the case of a `tkicker`, the field :code:`B` cannot be used and only `hkick` and `vkick`
can be used.

.. note:: Pole face rotation and fringe fields kicks are unavailable for tkickers

rf
^^^^

.. figure:: figures/rfcavity.png
	    :width: 50%
	    :align: right

`rf` or `rfcavity` defines an RF cavity with a time varying electric or electromagnetic field.
There are several geometry and field options as well as ways to specify the strength.
The default field is a uniform (in space) electric-only field that is time varying
according to a cosine (see :ref:`field-sinusoid-efield`).  Optionally, the electromagnetic
field for a pill-box cavity may be used (see :ref:`field-pill-box`). The `G4ClassicalRK4`
numerical integrator is used to calculate the motion of particles in both cases.

.. note:: The design energy of the machine is not affected, so the strength and fields
	  of components after an RF cavity in a lattice are calculated with respect to
	  the design energy, the particle and therefore, design rigidity. The user should
	  scale the strength values appropriately if they wish to match the increased
	  energy of the particle.

.. warning:: The elliptical cavity geometry may not render or appear in the Geant4
	     QT visualiser.  The geometry exists and is valid, but this is due to
	     deficiencies of the Geant4 visualisation system. The geometry exists
	     and is fully functional.

* The field is such that a positive E-field results in acceleration of the primary particle.
* The phase is calculated automatically such that zero phase results in the peak E-field at
  the centre of the component for its position in the lattice.
* Either `tOffset` or `phase` may be used to specify the phase of the oscillator.
* The material must be specified in the `rf` gmad element or in the attached cavity model
  by name. The cavity model will override the element material.

If `tOffset` is specified, a phase offset is calculated from this time for the speed
of light in a vacuum. Otherwise, the curvilinear S-coordinate of the centre of the rf
element is used to find the phase offset.

If `phase` is specified, this is added to the calculated phase offset from either the lattice
position or `tOffset`.

Simple examples::

   rf1: rf, l=10*cm, E=10*MV, frequency=90*MHz, phase=0.02;
   rf2: rf, l=10*cm, gradient=14*MV / m, frequency=450*MHz;
   rf3: rf, l=10*cm, E=10*MV, frequency=90*MHz, tOffset=3.2*ns;

Rather than just a simple E-field, an electromagnetic field that is the solution to
a cylindrical pill-box cavity may be used. A cavity object (described in more detail
below) is used to specify the field type. All other cavity parameters may be safely ignored
and only the field type will be used. The field is described in :ref:`field-pill-box`.

rcol
^^^^

.. figure:: figures/rcol.png
	    :width: 30%
	    :align: right

`rcol` defines a rectangular collimator. The aperture is rectangular and the external
volume is square.

=================  =================================  ==========  ===========
Parameter          Description                        Default     Required
`l`                Length [m]                         0           Yes
`xsize`            Horizontal half aperture [m]       0           Yes
`ysize`            Vertical half aperture [m]         0           Yes
`xsizeOut`         Horizontal exit half aperture [m]  0           No
`ysizeOut`         Vertical exit half aperture [m]    0           No
`material`         Outer material                     G4_Cu       No
`horizontalWidth`  Outer full width [m]               0.5 m       No
=================  =================================  ==========  ===========

.. note:: The collimator can be tapered by specifying an exit aperture size with `xsizeOut` and
	  `ysizeOut`, with the `xsize` and `ysize` parameters defining the entrance aperture.


Examples::

   ! Standard
   TCP15: rcol, l=1.22*m, material="graphite", xsize=104*um, ysize=5*cm;

   ! Tapered
   TCP16: rcol, l=1.22*m, material="graphite", xsize=104*um, ysize=5*cm, xsizeOut=208*um, ysizeOut=10*cm;


ecol

.. figure:: figures/ecol.png
	    :width: 30%
	    :align: right

`ecol` defines an elliptical collimator. This is exactly the same as `rcol` except that
the aperture is elliptical and the `xsize` and `ysize` define the horizontal and vertical
half-axes respectively. When tapered, the ratio between the horizontal and vertical half-
axes of the entrance aperture must be the same ratio for the exit aperture.

jcol
^^^^

.. figure:: figures/jcol.png
	    :width: 30%
	    :align: right


`jcol` defines a jaw collimator with two square blocks on either side in the horizontal plane.
If a vertical `jcol` is required, the `tilt` parameter should be used to rotate it by `pi/2`.
The horizontal position of each jaw can be set separately with the `xsizeLeft` and `xsizeRight`
apertures which are the distances from the center of element to the left and right jaws respectively.

=================  =================================  ==========  ===========
Parameter          Description                        Default     Required
`l`                Length [m]                         0           Yes
`xsize`            Horizontal half aperture [m]       0           Yes
`ysize`            Half height of jaws [m]            0           Yes
`xsizeLeft`        Left jaw aperture [m]              0           No
`xsizeRight`       Right jaw aperture [m]             0           No
`material`         Outer material                     G4_Cu       No
`horizontalWidth`  Outer full width [m]               0.5 m       No
=================  =================================  ==========  ===========

* The `horizontalWidth` must be greater than 2x `xsize`.
* To prevent the jaws overlapping with one another, a jaw cannot be constructed that crosses the
  X axis of the element (i.e supplying a negative `xsizeLeft` or `xsizeRight` will not work). Should
  you require this, please offset the element using the element parameters `offsetX` and `offsetY` instead.
* To construct a collimator jaws with one jaw closed (i.e. an offset of 0), the horizontal half aperture
  must be set to 0, with the other jaws half aperture set as appropriate.
* If `xsize`, `xsizeLeft` and `xsizeRight` are not specified, the collimator will be constructed
  as a box with no aperture.
* Specifying a jaw aperture which is larger than half the `horizontalWidth` value will result in
  that jaw not being constructed. If both jaw apertures are greater than half the `horizontalWidth`,
  no jaws will be built and BDSIM will exit.

Examples::

   ! Standard
   TCP15: jcol, l=1.22*m, material="graphite", xsize=0.1*cm, ysize=5*cm;

`outerDiameter`        Outer full width [m]                     global      No
===================    =======================================  ==========  ===========

.. note:: Either `materialThickness` or `degraderOffset` can be specified to adjust the horizontal lateral wedge
          position, and consequently the total material thickness the beam can propagate through. If both are
          specified, `degraderOffset` will be ignored.

          When numberWedges is specified to be n, the degrader will consist of n-1 `full` wedges and two `half` wedges.
          When viewed from above, a `full` wedge appears as an isosceles triangle, and a `half` wedge appears as a right-angled
          triangle.

=====================  ===============================================  ==========  ==========

* The angle is the rotation from vertical in the clock-wise direction looing in the
  positive S direction (the usualy direction of the beam).

The offsets are with respect to the centre of the beam pipe section the wire is placed inside.
This should therefore be less than half the element length `l`. The usual beam pipe parameters
can be specified and apply the to the beam pipe. For example, `material` is used for the beam
pipe material whereas `wireMaterial` is used for the material of the wire.

The user should take care to define a wire long enough to intercept the beam but be sufficiently
short to fit inside the beam pipe given the offsets in x, y and z. Checks are made on the end
points of the wire.

Examples::

    ws45Deg: wirescanner, l=4*cm, wireDiameter=0.1*mm, wireLength=5*cm,
                          wireOffsetX=1*cm, angle=pi/4, wireMaterial="C",

.. _element:

element
^^^^^^^

`element` defines an arbitrary element that's defined by externally provided geometry. It includes
the possibility of overlaying a field as well. Several geometry formats are supported. The user
must supply the length (accurately) as well as a diameter, such that the geometry will be
contained in a box that has horizontal and vertical sizes of diameter.

The geometry is simply placed in the beam line. There is no placement offset other than the
offset and tilt of the element in the beam line. Therefore, the user must prepare geometry
with the placement as required.

An alternative strategy is to use the `gap`_ beam line element
and make a placement at the appropriate point in global coordinates.

+-----------------+----------------------------------+--------------+---------------+

`geometryFile` should be of the format `format:filename`, where `format` is the geometry
format being used (`gdml` | `gmad` | `mokka`) and filename is the path to the geometry
file. See :ref:`externally-provided-geometry` for more details.

`fieldAll` should refer to the name of a field object the user has defined in the input
gmad file. The syntax for this is described in :ref:`field-maps`.

.. note:: The length must be larger than the geometry so that it is contained within it and
	  no overlapping geometry will be produced. However, care must be taken, as the length
	  will be the length of the component inserted in the beamline.  If this is much larger
	  than the size required for the geometry, the beam may be mismatched into the rest of
	  the accelerator. A common practice is to add a picometre to the length of the geometry.

Simple example::

  detector: element, geometryFile="gdml:atlasreduced.gdml", outerDiameter=10*m,l=44*m;

Example with field::

  somefield: field, type="ebmap2d",
		    eScaling = 3.1e3,
		    bScaling = 0.5,
		    integrator = "g4classicalrk4",
		    magneticFile = "poisson2d:/Path/To/File.TXT",
		    magneticInterpolator = "nearest2D",
		    electricFile = "poisson2d:/Another/File.TX",
		    electricInterpolator = "linear2D";

   detec: element, geometryFile="mokka:qq.sql", fieldAll="somefield", l=5*m, outerDiameter=0.76*m;

.. note:: For GDML geometry, we preprocess the input file prepending all names with the name
	  of the element. This is to compensate for the fact that the Geant4 GDML loader does
	  not handle unique file names. However, in the case of very large files with  many
	  vertices, the preprocessing can dominate. In this case, the option `preprocessGDML`
	  should be turned off. The loading will only work with one file in this case.


marker
^^^^^^
`marker` defines a point in the lattice. This element has no physical length and is only
used as a reference. For example, a `sampler` (see :ref:`sampler-output`)
is used to record particle passage at the
front of a component, but how would you record particles exiting a particular component?
The intended method is to use a `marker` and place it in the sequence after that element,
then attach a sampler to the marker.

Examples::

   m1: marker;

.. _aperture-parameters:

Aperture Parameters
-------------------

For elements that contain a beam pipe, several aperture models can be used. These aperture
parameters can be set as the default for every element using the :code:`option` command
(see `options`_ ) and
can be overridden for each element by specifying them with the element definition. The aperture
is controlled through the following parameters:

* `apertureType`
* `beampipeRadius` or `aper1`
* `aper2`
* `aper3`
* `aper4`
* `vacuumMaterial`
* `beampipeThickness`
* `beampipeMaterial`


For each aperture model, a different number of parameters are required. Here, we follow the MADX
convention and have four parameters. The user must specify them as required for that model.
BDSIM will check to see if the combination of parameters is valid. `beampipeRadius` and `aper1`
are degenerate.

Up to four parameters
can be used to specify the aperture shape (*aper1*, *aper2*, *aper3*, *aper4*).
These are used differently for each aperture model and match the MADX aperture definitions.
The required parameters and their meaning are given in the following table.

+-------------------+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------+------------------+

+-------------------+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------+------------------+

These parameters can be set with the *option* command, as the default parameters
and also on a per element basis that overrides the defaults for that specific element.

In the case of `clicpcl` (CLIC Post Collision Line), the beam pipe is asymmetric. The centre is
the same as the geometric centre of the bottom ellipse. Therefore, *aper4*, the y separation
between ellipses is added on to the 0 position. The parameterisation is taken from
Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams **12**, 021001 (2009).

.. _magnet-geometry-parameters:

Magnet Geometry Parameters
--------------------------

As well as the beam pipe, magnet beam line elements also have further outer geometry beyond the
beam pipe. This geometry typically represents the magnetic poles and yoke of the magnet but there
are several geometry types to choose from. The possible different styles are described below and
syntax **examples** can be found in *examples/features/geometry/4_magnets/*.

* Externally provided geometry can also be wrapped around the beam pipe (detailed below).

The magnet geometry is controlled by the following parameters.

.. note:: These can all be specified using the `option` command as well as on a per element
	  basis, but in this case they act as a default that will be used if none are
	  specified by the element.

Examples::

  option, magnetGeometryType = "polesfacetcrop",
          outerDiameter = 0.5*m;

::

   m1: quadrupole, l=0.3*m,
                   k1=0.03,
		   magnetGeometryType="gdml:geometryfiles/quad.gdml",
		   outerDiameter = 0.5*m;

.. warning:: The choice of magnet outer geometry will significantly affect the beam loss pattern in the
	     simulation, as particles and radiation may propagate much further along the beam line when
	     a magnet geometry with poles is used.

.. note:: Should a custom selection of various magnet styles be required for your simulation, please
	  contact us (see :ref:`feature-request`) and this can be added - it is a relatively simple process.

No Magnet Outer Geometry - "`none`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No geometry for the magnet outer part is built at all and nothing is placed in the model. This results
in only a beam pipe with the correct fields being provided.

.. image:: figures/none_beamline.png
	   :width: 60%
	   :align: center

Cylindrical - "`cylindrical`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The beam pipe is surrounded by a cylinder of material (the default is iron) whose outer diameter
is controlled by the `outerDiameter` parameter. In the case of beam pipes that are not circular
in cross-section, the cylinder fits directly against the outside of the beam pipe.

This geometry is useful when a specific geometry is not known. The surrounding
magnet volume acts to produce secondary radiation as well as act as material for energy deposition,
therefore this geometry is best suited for the most general studies.

	    :width: 40%

.. figure:: figures/cylindrical_sextupole.png
	    :width: 40%


Poles Circular - "`polescircular`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry has simple iron poles according to the order of the magnet and the yoke is
represented by an annulus. Currently no coils are implemented. If a non-symmetric beam pipe
geometry is used, the larger of the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the beam pipe will be
used to create the circular aperture at the pole tips.

	    :width: 40%


Poles Square (Default) - "`polessquare`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry has again, individual poles according to the order of the magnet but the
yoke is an upright square section to which the poles are attached. This geometry behaves in the
same way as `polescircular` with regard to the beam pipe size.

`outerDiameter` is the full width of the magnet horizontally as shown in the figure below,
**not** the diagonal width.

	    :width: 40%

	    :width: 40%

.. figure:: figures/polessquare_sextupole_3d.png
	    :width: 40%


Poles Faceted - "`polesfacet`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry is much like `polessquare`; however, the yoke is such that the pole always
joins at a flat piece of yoke and not in a corner. This geometry behaves in the
same way as `polescircular` with regards to the beam pipe size.

`outerDiameter` is the full width as shown in the figure.

.. figure:: figures/polesfacet_quadrupole.png
	    :width: 40%

	    :width: 40%

.. figure:: figures/polesfacet_sextupole_3d.png
	    :width: 40%


Poles Faceted with Crop - "`polesfacetcrop`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry is quite similar to `polesfacet`, but the yoke in between each
pole is cropped to form another facet. This results in the magnet geometry having
double the number of poles as sides.

`outerDiameter` is the full width horizontally as shown in the figure.

	    :width: 40%


LHC Left & Right - "`lhcleft`" | "`lhcright`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.7

`lhcleft` and `lhcright` provide more detailed magnet geometry appropriate for the LHC. Here, the
left and right suffixes refer to the shift of the magnet body with respect to the reference beam line.
Therefore, `lhcleft` has the magnet body shifted to the left in the direction of beam travel and the
'active' beam pipe is the right one. Vice versa for the `lhcright` geometry.

For this geometry, only the `sbend` and `quadrupole` have been implemented.  All other magnet geometry
defaults to the cylindrical set.

This geometry is parameterised to a degree regarding the beam pipe chosen.  Of course, parameters similar
to the LHC make most sense, as does use of the `lhcdetailed` aperture type. Examples are shown with various
beam pipes and both `sbend` and `quadrupole` geometries.

.. _offsets-and-tilts:

Offsets & Tilts - Component Misalignment
----------------------------------------

To simulate a real accelerator it may be necessary to introduce measured placement offsets or misalignments
and rotations. Every component can be displaced transversely and rotated along the axis of the beam propagation.

.. note:: Components that have a finite angle (rbend and sbend) will only respond to tilt and not vertical or
	  horizontal offsets. This is because these would change the length of the bend about its central axis.
	  This is not currently handled but may be implemented in future releases.

.. note:: A tilt on a component with a finite angle causes the axis the angle is induced in (typically the y-
	  axis) to be rotated without rotating the reference frame of the beam, i.e. a dipole with a :math:`\pi/2`
	  tilt will become a vertical bend without flipping x and y in the sampler or subsequent components. This
	  matches the behaviour of MAD8 and MADX.

.. note:: A right-handed coordinate system is used and the beamline is built along the `z` direction.

The misalignments can be controlled through the following parameters.

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter    | Default value                                                                      |
+==============+====================================================================================+
| `offsetX`    | Horizontal displacement of the component [m]                                       |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `offsetY`    | Vertical displacement of the component [m]                                         |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `tilt`       | Clockwise rotation of the component, facing in the direction of the beamline       |
|              | `z` [rad]. In the case of an rbend or sbend, this rotates the axis about which the |
|	       | beam bends.                                                                        |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Examples::

  d1: drift, l=1*m, offsetX=1*cm;
  d2: drift, l=0.5*m, offsetY = 0.3*cm, tilt=0.003;

in gmad and attaching it by name to an element.  The following parameters may be added
to a cavity object:

.. _field-maps:

Fields
------

BDSIM provides the facility to overlay pure magnetic, pure electric or combined electromagnetic fields
on an element, as defined by an externally provided field map. This can be done for 1) only the vacuum
volume; 2) only the volume outside the vacuum (i.e. the yoke); 3) or one full map for the whole
element.  BDSIM allows any Geant4 integrator to be used to calculate the motion of the particle, which
can be chosen given knowledge of the smoothness of the field or the application. BDSIM also provides
a selection of 1-4D interpolators that are used to provide the field value in between the data points
in the supplied field map.

To overlay a field, one must define a field 'object' in the parser and then 'attach' it to an element.

* Fields are in a local Cartesian coordinate system with respect to the origin of the
  element they are attached to.
* The field may be attached to everything "fieldAll"; the vacuum volume "fieldVacuum", or the yoke "fieldOuter".
* Magnetic and electric field maps are specified in separate files and may have different interpolators.
* Fields may have up to four dimensions.

The dimensions are (by default) in order :math:`x,y,z,t`. For example, specifying a 3D field will be
:math:`x,y,z` and a 2D field :math:`x,y`.

For BDSIM format fields (see :ref:`model-description-field-formats`, :ref:`field-map-formats` and
:ref:`fields-different-dimensions`),
the user can however specify different dimension with the other dimensions being assumed constant.
For example, a field that varies in :math:`x,z` is possible (assumed constant in :math:`y`). For
BDSIM format fields, this is detected automatically by the column labelling and the keys in the
header of the file that specify the ranges in each dimension. The dimensions must however be in
ascending or descending order.

.. Note:: Currently only **regular** (evenly spaced) grids are supported with field maps. It would
	  require significant development to extend this to irregular grids. It's strongly
	  recommended the user re-sample any existing field map into a regular grid. A regular
	  grid is also much faster for tracking purposes.

Here is example syntax to define a field object named 'somefield' in the parser and overlay it onto
a drift pipe where it covers the full volume of the drift (not outside it though)::

  somefield: field, type="ebmap2d",
		    eScaling = 3.0,
		    bScaling = 0.4,
		    integrator = "g4classicalrk4",
		    magneticFile = "poisson2d:/Path/To/File.TXT",
		    magneticInterpolator = "nearest2D",
		    electricFile = "poisson2d:/Another/File.TXT",
		    electricInterpolator = "linear2D";

  d1: drift, l=0.5*m, aper1=4*cm, fieldAll="somefield";

Each beam line element will allow "fieldAll", "fieldVacuum" and "fieldOuter" to be specified.

When defining a field, the following parameters can be specified.

.. Note:: Either axis angle (with unit axis 3-vector) or Euler angles can be used to provide
	  the rotation between the element the field maps are attached to and the coordinates
	  of the field map. Use `axisAngle=1` to use the axis angle rotation scheme.

.. Note:: A right-handed coordinate system is used in Geant4, so positive x is out of a ring.

Field maps in the following formats are accepted:

  * BDSIM's own format (both uncompressed :code:`.dat` and gzip compressed files. :code:`gz` must be
    in the file name for this to load correctly.)
  * Superfish Poisson 2D SF7

These are described in detail below. More field formats can be added
relatively easily - see :ref:`feature-request`. A detailed description
of the formats is given in :ref:`field-map-formats`. A preparation guide
for BDSIM format files is provided here :ref:`field-map-file-preparation`.


Integrators
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following integrators are provided.  The majority are interfaces to Geant4 integrators.
*g4classicalrk4* is typically the recommended default and is very robust.
*g4cakskarprkf45* is similar but slightly less CPU-intensive. For version Geant4.10.4
onwards, *g4dormandprince745* is the default recommended by Geant4 (although not the
BDSIM default currently). Note: any integrator capable of operating on EM fields
will work on solely B- or E-fields.

We recommend looking at the source .hh files in the Geant4 source code for an
explanation of each, as this is where they are documented. The source files can
be found in `<geant4-source-dir>/source/geometry/magneticfield/include`.

Interpolators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The field may be queried at any point inside the volume, so an interpolator is required
to provide a value of the field in between specified points in the field map.
There are many algorithms that can be used to interpolate the field map data. A
mathematical description of the ones provided in BDSIM as well as example plots
is shown in :ref:`field-interpolators`.

.. _externally-provided-geometry:

Externally Provided Geometry
----------------------------

BDSIM provides the ability to use externally provided geometry in the Geant4 model constructed
by BDSIM. A variety of formats are supported (see :ref:`geometry-formats`). External
geometry can be used in three ways:

1) A placement of a piece of geometry unrelated to the beam line.
2) Wrapped around the beam pipe in a BDSIM magnet element.
3) As a general element in the beam line where the geometry constitutes the whole object.
4) As the world volume in which the BDSIM beamline is placed.

These are discussed in order in :ref:`placements`, :ref:`external-magnet-geometry` and
:ref:`element-external-geometry`.

.. _geometry-formats:

Geometry Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following geometry formats are supported. More may be added in collaboration with the BDSIM
developers - please see :ref:`feature-request`. The syntax and preparation of these geometry
formats are described in more detail in :ref:`external-geometry-formats`.

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Format String**    | **Description**                                                     |

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: BDSIM must be compiled with the GDML build option in CMake turned on for gdml loading to work.

.. note:: For GDML geometry, we preprocess the input file prepending all names with the name
	  of the element. This is to compensate for the fact that the Geant4 GDML loader does
	  not handle unique file names. However, in the case of very large files with many
	  vertices, the preprocessing can dominate. In this case, the option `preprocessGDML`
	  should be turned off. The loading will only work with one file in this case.

.. warning:: If a geometry file path is defined relative to the location of the GMAD file and that
	     GMAD file is included in a parent file in a different location, the file will not be
	     correctly located (i.e. main.gmad includes ../somedir/anotherfile.gmad, which defines
	     geometry in "../a/relative/path/geometryfile.gdml". The file will not be found). If all
	     GMAD files are located in the same directory, this will not be a problem. It is better / cleaner
	     overall to use multiple GMAD input files and include them.

.. _external-world-geometry:

External World Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

External geometry can be supplied as the world volume with the option `worldGeometryFile`. The BDSIM
beamline will be placed inside this world volume. Unlike the standard BDSIM world volume whose size is
set dynamically, the external world volume will have fixed dimensions, therefore the user should supply
a world volume of sufficient size so as to fully encompass the BDSIM beamline. Should the extents of the
BDSIM beamline be larger than the world extents, the beamline will not be constructed and BDSIM will exit.

`worldGeometryFile` should be of the format `format:filename`, where `format` is the geometry
format being used (`gdml` | `gmad` | `mokka`) and filename is the path to the geometry
file. See :ref:`externally-provided-geometry` for more details.

.. _placements:

Placements
----------

Geometry provided in an external file may be placed at any location in the world with
any rotation. This is intended to place geometry alongside the beam line and **not** inside
or as part of it. The user is responsible for ensuring that the geometry does not
overlap with any other geometry including the beam line. Only in special cases, such as
for a magnet yoke, can externally provided geometry be placed "inside" BDSIM geometry.

For geometry to be placed in the beam line, use the :ref:`element`.

.. warning:: If the geometry overlaps, tracking faults may occur from Geant4 as well as
	     incorrect results and there may not always be warnings provided. For this reason,
	     BDSIM will **always** use the Geant4 overlap checker when placing external geometry
	     into the world volume. This only ensures the container doesn't overlap with BDSIM
	     geometry, not that the internal geometry is valid.

.. warning:: You cannot place external geometry 'inside' an accelerator component with a
	     placement. Although it may appear OK in the visualiser, the hierarchy of the
	     geometry will be wrong and the tracking will not work as expected. Avoid this.

There are 3 possible ways to place a piece of geometry.

1) In global Cartesian coordinates.

   `x`, `y`, `z` and any rotation are with respect to the world frame of reference.
   
2) In curvilinear coordinates.

   `s`, `x`, `y` are used along with a rotation. The transform for the distance `s` along the beamline
   is first applied. `x`, `y` and the rotation are with respect to that frame.

3) In curvilinear coordinates with respect to a beam line element by name.

   The name of an element is used to look up its `s` coordinate. `s`, `x`, `y` and the rotation
   are with respect to the centre of that element. **Therefore**, `s` in this case is `local` curvilinear
   `s`.

The scenario is automatically selected based on which parameters are set. If `s` is finite, then
it is either scenario 2 or 3. If `referenceElement` is specified, scenario 3 is assumed.

.. warning:: For both scenarios 2) and 3), a placement can only be made **inside** the S length of
	     the accelerator - it is not possible to place something beyond the accelerator currently.
	     In this case, the user should resort to a global placement.
	     
The following parameters may be specified with a placement in BDSIM:

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Parameter**           |  **Description**                                                   |

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| y                       | Offset in global y                                                 |

| axisZ                   | Axis angle rotation z-component of unit vector                     |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| axisAngle               | Boolean whether to use axis angle rotation scheme (default false)  |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sensitive               | Whether the geometry records energy deposition (default true)      |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| referenceElement        | Name of element to place geometry with respect to (string)         |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| referenceElementNumber  | Occurence of `referenceElement` to place with respect to if it     |
|                         | is used more than once in the sequence. Zero counting.             |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

`referenceElementNumber` is the occurence of that element in the sequence. For example, if a sequence
was::

  l1: line=(d1,sb1,d2,qd1,d2,df1,d2,sb1,d1);

and we wanted to place with respect to the first element, we would use::

  p1: placement, referenceElement="d1",
                 referenceElementNumber=0;

If 0, the `referenceElementNumber` argument is optional. If we want to place with respect to
the third usage of "d2", we would use::

  p1: placement, referenceElement="d2",
                 referenceElementNumber=3;

.. note:: Dipoles are split in BDSIM into many small straight sections. These must have a unique
	  name to appear correctly in the Geant4 visualisation system. The splitting is done
	  dynamically based on the angle of the bend and if it has pole face rotations on one
	  or both sides. The names are mangled and so the original name will not be found.
	  The user should run the visualiser first
	  and identify the name of the segment of the dipole they wish to place with respect to.
	  Alternatively, in the case of low angle bends, the element before or after can be used
	  with a finite `s` offset.

* Examples can be found in :code:`bdsim/examples/features/geometry/13_placements`.
* The file path provided in :code:`geometryFile` should either be relative to where bdsim
  is executed from or an absolute path.
* The main beam line begins at (0,0,0) by default but may be offset.  See
  :ref:`beamline-offset` for more details.


Two styles of rotation can be used: either a set of three Euler angles, or the axis angle
rotation scheme, where a **unit** vector is provided in :math:`x,y,z` and an angle to
rotate about that. These variables are used to construct a :code:`G4RotationMatrix`
directly, which is also the same as a :code:`CLHEP::HepRotation`.

.. Note:: Geant4 uses a right-handed coordinate system and :math:`m` and :math:`rad` are
	  the default units for offsets and angles in BDSIM.

The following is an example syntax used to place a piece of geometry::

  leadblock: placement, x = 10*m,
                        y = 3*cm,
			z = 12*m,
			geometryFile="gdml:mygeometry/detector.gdml";

.. warning:: Care must be taken not to define the same placement name twice. If `leadblock`
	     were declared again here, the first definition would be updated with parameters
	     from the second, leading to possibly unexpected geometry.
	     
.. _external-magnet-geometry:

External Magnet Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A geometry file may be placed around a beam pipe inside a BDSIM magnet instance. The beam pipe
will be constructed as normal and will use the appropriate BDSIM tracking routines, but the
yoke geometry will be loaded from the file provided. The external geometry must have a cut out
in its container volume for the beam pipe to fit, i.e. both the beam pipe and the yoke exist
at the same level in the geometry hierarchy (both are placed in one container for the magnet).
The beam pipe is not placed 'inside' the yoke.

This will work for `solenoid`, `sbend`, `rbend`, `quadrupole`, `sextupole`, `octupole`,
`decapole`, `multipole`, `muonspoiler`, `vkicker`, `hkicker` element types in BDSIM.

Example::

  q1: quadrupole, l=20*cm, k1=0.0235, magnetGeometryType="gdml:mygeometry/atf2quad.gdml";

.. _element-external-geometry:

Element
^^^^^^^

A general piece of geometry may be placed in the beam line along with any externally provided
field map using the `element` beam line element.  See `element`_.

.. _lattice-sequence:

Lattice Sequence
----------------

Once all the necessary components have been defined, they must be placed in a sequence to make
a lattice. Elements can be repeated. A sequence of elements is defined by
a `line`_. Lines of lines can be made to describe the accelerator sequence programmatically, i.e.
::

   d1: drift, l=3*m;
   q1: quadrupole, l=0.1*m, k1=0.684;
   q2: quadrupole, l=0.1*m, k1=-0.684;
   fodo: line = (q1,d1,q2,d1);
   transportline: line(fodo, fodo, fodo, fodo);


Line
^^^^

`line` defines a sequence of elements. ::

  name: line=(element1, element2, element3, ... );

Here, `element` can be any element or line. Lines can also be reversed using ::

  line_name : line=-(line_2)

or within another line by::

  line=(line_1,-line_2)

Reversing a line also reverses all nested lines within.

.. _the-use-command:

use - Defining which Line to Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once all elements and at least one `line` is defined, the main sequence of the
beam line can be defined. This must be defined using the following syntax::

  use, period=<line_name>

Examples::

   d1: drift, l=3.2*m;
   q1: quadrupole, l=20*cm, k1=4.5;
   q2: quadrupole, l=20*cm, k1=-4.5;
   fodo: line=(d1,q1,d1,q2,d1);
   use, period=fodo;

The beam line is placed in the world volume (the outermost coordinate system) starting
at position (0,0,0) with direction (0,0,1) - i.e. pointing in positive `z`. The user
may specify an initial offset and rotation for the beam line with respect to the world
volume using the options described in :ref:`beamline-offset`.

Multiple beam lines may also be visualised - but only visualised (not suitable for
simulations currently).  Details are provided in :ref:`multiple-beamlines`.


.. _sampler-output:

Output After An Element - Samplers
----------------------------------

BDSIM provides a `sampler` as a means to observe the particle distribution at a
point in the lattice. A sampler is 'attached' to an already defined element
and records all the particles passing through a plane at the **exit** face of
that element. They are defined using the following syntax::

  sample, range=<element_name>;

where `element_name` is the name of the element you wish to sample. Depending on the
output format chosen, the element name may be recorded in the output ('rootevent' output only).

.. note:: Samplers **can only** be defined **after** the main sequence has been defined
	  using the `use` command (see `use - Defining which Line to Use`_). Failure to do
	  so will result in an error and BDSIM will exit.

.. note:: Samplers record **all** particles impinging on them (i.e. both forwards and
	  backwards). Even secondary particles that may originate from further along the
	  lattice are recorded. They have no material so they do not absorb or affect particles, only
	  witness them.

To place a sampler before an item, attach it to the previous item. If however,
you wish to record the coordinates with another name rather than the name of the
element before, you can define a marker; place it in the sequence; and then define
a sampler that uses that marker::

  d1: drift, l=2.4*m;
  d2: drift, l=1*m;
  interestingplane: marker;
  l1: line=(d1,d1,interestingplane,d2,d1);
  use,period=l1;

  sample, range = interestingplane;

When an element is defined multiple times in the line (such as "d1" in the above example),
samplers will be attached to all instances. If you wish to sample only one specific
instance, the following syntax can be used::

  sample, range=<element_name>[index];

To attach samplers after all elements::

  sample, all;

And to attach samplers after all elements of a specific type::

  sample, <type>;

e.g. ::

  sample, quadrupole;

.. note:: If a sampler is placed at the very beginning of the lattice, it may appear
	  that approximately half of the primary particles seem to pass through it. This
	  is the correct behaviour, as unlike an optics program such as MADX, the sampler
	  represents a thin plane in 3D space in BDSIM. If the beam distribution has some
	  finite extent in *z* or *t*, particles may start beyond this first sampler and
	  never pass through it.

.. _sampler-dimensions:
	  
Sampler Dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sampler is represented by a cube solid that is 1 pm thin along z and 5m wide
transversely in x and y. If a smaller or larger capture area for the samplers is required,
the option *samplerDiameter* may be specified in the input gmad. ::

  option, samplerDiameter=3*m;

This affects all samplers.

.. note:: For a very low energy lattice with large angle bends, the default samplerDiameter
	  may cause geometrical overlap warnings from Geant4. This situation is difficult to
	  avoid automatically, but easy to remedy by setting the samplerDiameter to a lower
	  value.

Sampler Visualisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The samplers are normally invisible and are built in a parallel world geometry in Geant4. To
visualise them, the following command should be used in the visualiser::

  /vis/drawVolume worlds

The samplers will appear in semi-transparent green, as well as the curvilinear geometry used
for coordinate transforms (cylinders).

.. _physics-processes:

Physics Processes
-----------------

BDSIM can exploit all the physics processes that come with Geant4. It is advantageous to
define **only** the processes that should be simulated so
that the simulation is both relevant and efficient. By default, only tracking in magnetic fields
is provided and other processes must be specified to be used. Rather than specify each individual
particle physics process on a per-particle basis, a series of "physics lists" are provided that
are a predetermined set of physics processes suitable for a certain applications. BDSIM follows
the Geant4 ethos in this regard and the majority of those in BDSIM are simple shortcuts to the
Geant4 ones. These are fairly modular and can be added independently. More complete "reference
physics lists" from Geant4 (i.e. including several electromagnetic and hadronic physics lists)
are also accessible.

The modular physics list can be selected with the following syntax (delimited by a space)::

  option, physicsList = "physicslistname anotherphysicslistname";

  option, physicsList = "em optical";

The Geant4 reference physics can be used by prefixing their name with "g4". See :ref:`physics-geant4-lists`.

.. note:: Only one Geant4 reference physics list can be used and it cannot be used in combination
	  with any modular physics list.

For general high energy hadron physics we recommend::

  option, physicsList = "em ftfp_bert decay muon hadronic_elastic em_extra"

.. note:: Using extra physics processes that are not required will slow the simulation and produce
	  many orders of magnitude more particles, which in turn slow the simulation further. Therefore,
	  only use the minimal set of physics processes required.

.. note:: The strings for the modular physics list are case-insensitive.

Some physics lists are only available in later versions of Geant4. These are filtered at compile
time for BDSIM and it will not recognise a physics list that requires a later version of Geant4
than BDSIM was compiled with respect to.

A summary of the available physics lists in BDSIM is provided below (Others can be easily added
by contacting the developers - see :ref:`feature-request`).

BDSIM uses the Geant4 physics lists directly and more details can be found in the Geant4 documentation:

   * `Reference Physics Lists <http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc_mod_catalog/physics_lists/referencePL.shtml>`_
   * `Physics Reference Manual <http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/PhysicsReferenceManual/fo/PhysicsReferenceManual.pdf>`_
   * `Use Cases <http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc_mod_catalog/physics_lists/useCases.shtml>`_

Modular Physics Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: Not all physics lists can be used with all other physics lists. BDSIM will print
	     a warning and exit if this is the case. Generally, lists suffixed with "hp" should
	     not be used along with the unsuffixed ones (e.g. "qgsp_bert" and "qgsp_bert_hp" should
	     not be used together). Similarly, the standard electromagnetic variants should not
	     be used with the regular "em".

em_extra Physics Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The em_extra model is an interface to `G4EmExtraPhysics` that collects a variety of extra electromagnetic models
together. Not all of these are activated by default. BDSIM provides options to turn these components on and off.
See :ref:`physics-process-options` for more details on the specific options.

+------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+
| **Option**             | **Minimum Geant4 Version**  | **Default**  |
+========================+=============================+==============+
| useLENDGammaNuclear    | 10.4                        | Off          |
+------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+
| useElectroNuclear      | 10.4                        | On           |

| usePositronToHadrons   | 10.3                        | Off          |
+------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+

Example::

  option, physicsList="em em_extra",
          useMuonNuclear=1,
          useGammaToMuMu=1;

The options will always be accepted by BDSIM if an earlier version of Geant4 is used than supported, however,
these will have no effect.

`G4EmExtraPhysics` provides a simple interface to increase the cross-section of some processes. This interface
is not used in BDSIM, as it does not propagate the associated weights correctly. Biasing should be done through
the generic biasing interface with the name of the process (described in the following section), as this will
propagate the weights correctly.

.. _physics-biasing:

Physics Biasing
---------------

A physics biasing process can be defined with the keyword **xsecbias**.

.. note:: This only works with Geant4 version 10.1 or higher.

=================== ================================================
Parameter           Description
name                Biasing process name
particle            Particle that will be biased
proc                Process(es) to be biased
flag                Flag which particles are biased for the process(es)
                    (1=all, 2=primaries, 3=secondaries)
xsecfact            Biasing factor(s) for the process(es)
=================== ================================================

Example::

  biasDef1: xsecBias, particle="e-", proc="all", xsecfact=10, flag=3;
  biasDef2: xsecBias, particle="e+", proc="eBrem eIoni msc", xsecfact={10,1,5}, flag={1,1,2};

The process can also be attached to a specific element using the keywords `biasVacuum` or
`biasMaterial` for the biasing to be attached the vacuum volume or everything outside the
vacuum respectively::

  q1: quadrupole, l=1*m, material="Iron", biasVacuum="biasDef1 biasDef2"; ! uses the process biasDef1 and biasDef2
  q2: quadrupole, l=0.5*m, biasMaterial="biasDef2";

.. _bdsim-options:

Options
-------

Various simulation details can be controlled through the `option` command. Options are defined
using the following syntax::

  option, <option_name>=<value>;

Values accepted can be a number (integer, floating point or scientific notation), a string
with the value enclosed in "double inverted commas", or a Boolean. For Boolean options (described
as on or off, or true or false) a number 1 or 0 is used.

Multiple options can be defined at once using the following syntax::

  option, <option1> = <value>,
          <option2> = <value>;

.. note:: No options are required to be specified to run a BDSIM model.  Defaults will be used in
	  all cases.  However, we do recommend you select an appropriate physics list and beam pipe
	  radius, as these will have a large impact on the outcome of the simulation.

Below is a full list of all options in BDSIM. Please also see :ref:`executable-options` for options
that are used on the command line when executing BDSIM. The executable options override whatever
options are specified in the input gmad files.

Common options are duplicated below for convenience as these are the most useful ones. All options
are described in the following sub-sections:

* `General Run Options`_
* `Geometry Options`_
* `Tracking Options`_
* :ref:`physics-process-options`
* `Visualisation`_
* `Output Options`_
* `One Turn Map`_
* `Offset for Main Beam Line`_
* `Scoring Map`_
* `Developer Options`_

Output Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The particle physics simulation in BDSIM can produce an impressive quantity of output
information. The data describing a full record of every particle and their interaction
would prove too difficult to manage or analyse sensibly. BDSIM records the most useful
information, but provides options to record even more data. This is controlled with the
following options.

.. note:: These options may increase the output file size by a large amount. Use only the
	  ones you need.

.. _one-turn-map:

One Turn Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Geant4 mandates that there are no overlaps between solids, which in
BDSIM means that a thin 1 |nbsp| nm gap is placed between each lattice
element.  Whilst these thin gaps have a negligible effect for a single
pass or turn, over several turns it introduces a sizeable inaccuracy
in the tracking.  To correct for this, BDSIM models can be supplmented
with a one turn map which is applied at the end of each turn to right
the primary back onto the correct trajectory.  To ensure physical
results the one turn map is only applied to primaries, if they did not
interact on the previous turn, and if they are within 5% of the
reference momentum.  The one turn map is also not applied on the first
turn where there the beam is offset in S, but applied on following
turns, still accounting for the exceptions mentioned above.

The map must be of the format as written by MADX-PTC's ``PTC_NORMAL``
command.  A one turn map (in this case, 12th order) can be generated
in MAD-X with the following::

  PTC_CREATE_UNIVERSE;
  PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT, model=2,method=6,nst=10, exact=true, resplit, xbend;
  PTC_NORMAL,maptable,icase=5,no=12;
  write, table="map_table", file="my_oneturn_map_file";
  PTC_END;

To use then use the one turn map with BDSIM::

  option, ptcOneTurnMapFileName="path/to/my_oneturn_map_file";

Two styles of rotation can be used: either a set of three Euler angles, or the axis angle
rotation scheme where a **unit** vector is provided in :math:`x,y,z` and an angle to
rotate about it. These variables are used to construct a :code:`G4RotationMatrix`
directly, which is also the same as a :code:`CLHEP::HepRotation`.

.. Note:: Geant4 uses a right-handed coordinate system and :math:`m` and :math:`rad` are
	  the default units for offsets and angles in BDSIM.

Example::

  option, beamlineX = 3*m,
          beamlineY = 20*cm,
	  beamlineZ = -30*m,
	  beamlineAxisAngle = 1,
	  beamlineAxisY = 1,
	  beamlineAngle = 0.2;

This offsets the beam line by (3,0.2,-30) m and rotates about the unit vector (0,1,0) (i.e. in the
horizontal plane - x,z) by 0.2 rad.

.. _beam-parameters:

Beam Parameters
---------------

To specify the input particle distribution to the accelerator model, the `beam` command is
used. This also specifies the particle species and **reference total energy**, which is the
design total energy of the machine. This is used along with the particle species to calculate
the momentum of the reference particle and therefore the magnetic rigidity that magnetic
field strengths are calculated with respect to. For example, the field of dipole magnets
is calculated using this if only the `angle` parameter has been specified.

Apart from the design particle and energy, a beam of particles of a different species and total
energy may be specified. By default, if only one particle is specified this is assumed to be
both the design particle and the particle used for the beam distribution.

.. note:: The design energy is required to be specified, but the central energy, of say
	  a bunch with a Gaussian distribution, can be also be specified with `E0`.

.. note:: `energy` here is the **total energy** of the particle. This must be greater than
	  the rest mass of the particle.

The user **must** specify at least `energy` and the `particle` type. In this case the
`reference`_ distribution will be used as well as default parameters. The minimum
beam definitions are::

  beam, particle="proton",
        energy=34.2*GeV;


Other parameters, such
as the beam distribution type, `distrType`, are optional and can be specified as described
in the following sections. The beam is defined using the following syntax::

  beam, particle="proton",
        energy=4.0*TeV,
	distrType="reference";

Energy is the total energy in `GeV`. The beam particle may be one of the following:

* `e-` or `e+`
* `proton` or `antiproton`
* `gamma`
* `neutron`
* `mu-` or `mu+`
* `pi-` or `pi+`
* `photon` or `gamma`

In fact, the user may specify any particle that is available through the physics lists
used. The particle must be given by the Geant4 name. The ones above are always defined
and so can always safely be used irrespective of the physics lists used. If the particle
definition is not found, BDSIM will print a warning and exit.

Ion Beams
^^^^^^^^^

The user may also specify any ion with the following syntax::

  beam, particle="ion A Z";

or::

  beam, particle="ion A Z Q";

where `A`, `Z` and `Q` should be replaced by the atomic number, the number of protons
in the nucleus and the charge. The charge is optional and by default is Z (i.e. a fully
ionised ion). In this case, it is recommended to use the `ion` physicslist.

Available input distributions and their associated parameters are described in the following
section.

Different Beam and Design Particles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The model may use one particle for design and one for the beam distribution. The "design" particle
is used to calculate the rigidity that is used along with normalised field strengths (such as
:code:`k1` for quadrupoles) to calculate an absolute field or field gradient. However, it is
often useful to simulate a beam of other particles. To specify a different central energy, the
parameter :code:`E0` should be used. If a different particle is required the parameter
:code:`beamParticleName` should be used. Examples::

   beam, particle="e-",
         energy=100*GeV,
	 beamParticleName="e+";

This specifies that the magnet field strengths are calculated with respect to a 100 GeV electron
and the beam tracked is a 100 GeV positron beam (along with any other relevant distribution parameters).::

   beam, particle="e-",
         energy=100*GeV,
	 beamParticleName="e+",
	 E0=20*GeV;

This specified that the magnet field strengths are calculated with respect to a 100 GeV electron
and the beam tracked is a 20 GeV positron beam.

* If no :code:`beamParticleName` variable is specified, it's assumed to be the same as :code:`particle`.
* If no :code:`E0` variable is specified, it's assumed to be the same as :code:`energy`.
	

Generate Only the Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BDSIM can generate only the input distribution and store it to file without creating a model or
running any physics simulation. This is very fast and can be used to verify the input distribution
with a large number of particles (for example, 10k to 100k in under one minute).

BDSIM should be executed with the option `--generatePrimariesOnly` as described in
:ref:`executable-options`.

Beam in Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the beam parameters are stored in the output, as described in :ref:`output-beam-tree`. The
particle coordinates used in the simualtion are stored directly in the Primary branch of the
Event Tree, as described in :ref:`output-event-tree`.

.. note:: These are the exact coordinates supplied to Geant4 at the beginning of the event.
	  Conceptually, these are 'local' coordinates with respect to the start of the beam
	  line. However, if a finite `S0` is specified, the bunch distribution is transformed
	  to that location in the World, therefore the coordinates are the **global** ones used.

.. warning:: For large `S0` in a large model, the particles may be displaced by a large
	     distance as compared to the size of the beam, e.g. 1km offset for 1um beam.
	     In this case, the limited precision of the `float` used to store the coordinates
	     in the output may not show the beam distribution as expected. Internally, double
	     precision numbers are used so that the beam distribution is accurate. A float typically
	     has seven significant figures and a double 15.

.. _beam-distributions:

Beam Distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following beam distributions are available in BDSIM

- `reference`_
- `gaussmatrix`_
- `gauss`_
- `gausstwiss`_
- `circle`_
- `square`_
- `ring`_
- `eshell`_
- `halo`_
- `composite`_
- `userfile`_
- `ptc`_

.. note:: For `gauss`_, `gaussmatrix`_ and `gausstwiss`_, the beam option `beam, offsetSampleMean=1`
	  documented in :ref:`developer-options` can be used to pre-generate all particle coordinates and
	  subtract the sample mean from these, effectively removing any small systematic offset in
	  the bunch at the beginning of the line. This is used only for optical comparisons currently.


reference
^^^^^^^^^
This is a single particle with the same position and angle defined by the following parameters. The
coordinates are the same for every particle fired using the reference distribution. It is therefore
not likely to be useful to generate a large number of repeated events with this distribution.

These parameters also act as **central** parameters for all other distributions. For example, a Gaussian
distribution may be defined with the `gauss`_ parameters, but with `X0` set to offset the centroid of the
Gaussian with respect to the reference trajectory. Note: **energy** is **total energy** of the particle
-including the rest mass.

Examples::

  beam, particle = "e-",
        energy = 10*GeV,
	distrType = "reference";

Generates a beam with all coordinates=0 at the nominal energy. ::

  beam, particle = "e-",
        energy = 10*GeV,
	distrType = "reference",
	X0 = 100*um,
	Y0 = 3.5*um;

Generates a particle with an offset of 100 :math:`\mu\mathrm{m}` horizontally and 3.5
:math:`\mu\mathrm{m}` vertically.

gaussmatrix
^^^^^^^^^^^

Uses the :math:`N` dimensional Gaussian generator from `CLHEP`, `CLHEP::RandMultiGauss`. The generator
is initialised by a :math:`6\times1` means vector and :math:`6\times 6` sigma matrix.

* All parameters from `reference`_ distribution are used as centroids.

+==================+===================================+
| `sigmaNM`        | Sigma matrix element (N,M)        |
+------------------+-----------------------------------+

* Only the upper-right half of the matrix and diagonal should be populated, as the
  elements are symmetric across the diagonal.
* The coordinates are in order 1:`x` (m), 2:`xp`, 3:`y` (m), 4:`yp`, 5:`t` (s), 6:`E` (GeV).

The user should take care to ensure they specify a positive definite matrix. BDSIM will
emit an error and stop running if this is not the case.

Examples::

   beam, particle = "e-",
         energy = 10*GeV,
	 distrType = "gaussmatrix",
	 sigma11 = 100*um,
	 sigma22 = 3*um,
	 sigma33 = 50*um,
	 sigma44 = 1.4*um,
	 sigma55 = 1e-12
	 sigma66 = 1e-4,
	 sigma12 = 1e-2,
	 sigma34 = 1.4e-3;

.. note:: One should take care in defining, say, sigma16, as this is the covariance of the `x` position
	  and energy. However, this may be proportional to momentum and not total energy. For such
	  a *correlation* between `x` and `E`, other off-diagonal terms would be finite also.

gauss
^^^^^

Uses the `gaussmatrix`_ beam generator but with simplified input parameters, as opposed to a complete
beam sigma matrix. This beam distribution has a diagonal :math:`\sigma`-matrix and does not allow for
correlations between phase space coordinates, so

.. math::
   \sigma_{11} & =  \sigma_x^2   \\
   \sigma_{22} & =  \sigma_x^{\prime 2}  \\
   \sigma_{33} & =  \sigma_y^2   \\
   \sigma_{44} & =  \sigma_y^{\prime 2}  \\
   \sigma_{55} & =  \sigma_{T}^2 \\
   \sigma_{66} & =  \sigma_{E}^2.

* The coordinates are in order 1:`x` (m), 2:`xp`, 3:`y` (m), 4:`yp`, 5:`t` (s), 6:`E` (GeV).
* All parameters from `reference`_ distribution are used as centroids.

^^^^^^^^^^

circle
^^^^^^

Beam of randomly distributed particles with a uniform distribution within a circle in each
dimension of phase space - `x` & `xp`; `y` & `yp`, `T` & `E` with each uncorrelated.
Each parameter defines the maximum absolute extent in that dimension, i.e. the possible values
range from `-envelopeX` to `envelopeX` for example. Total
energy is also uniformly distributed between $\pm$ `envelopeE`.

* All parameters from `reference`_ distribution are used as centroids.

.. _beam-halo-distribution:

halo
^^^^
The halo distribution is effectively a flat phase space with the central beam core removed at
:math:`\epsilon_{\rm core}`. The beam core is defined using the standard Twiss parameters described
previously. The implicit general form of a rotated ellipse is

.. math::

   \gamma x^2 + 2\alpha\;x\;x^{\prime} + \beta x^{\prime 2} = \epsilon

where the parameters have their usual meanings. A phase space point can be rejected or weighted
depending on the single particle emittance, which is calculated as

.. math::
   \epsilon_{\rm SP} = \gamma x^2 + 2\alpha\;x\;x^{\prime} + \beta x^{\prime 2}

if the single particle emittance is less than beam emittance, such that :math:`\epsilon_{\rm SP} < \epsilon_{\rm core}`
the particle is rejected. `haloPSWeightFunction` is a string that selects the function
:math:`f_{\rm haloWeight}(\epsilon_{\rm SP})` which is 1 at the ellipse defined by :math:`\epsilon_{\rm core}`. The
weighting functions are either `flat`, one over emittance `oneoverr` or exponential `exp`.

The horizontal, vertical and longitudinal phase spaces can be defined independently. The `xDistrType`,
`yDistrType` and `zDistrType` can be selected from all the other beam distribution types. All of the
appropriate parameters need to be defined for each individual distribution.

userFile
^^^^^^^^

The `userFile` distribution allows the user to supply an ASCII text file with particle
coordinates that are tab-delimited. The column names and the units are specified in an
input string.

The file may also be compressed using tar and gz. Any file with the extension `.tar.gz`
will be automatically decompressed during the run without any temporary files. This is
recommended, as compressed ASCII is significantly smaller in size.

If the number of particles to be generated with ngenerate is greater than the number of
particles defined in the file, the bunch generation will reload the file and read the
particle coordinates from the beginning.

This distribution reads lines at the start of each event to be memory efficient. However,
this prevents reading a whole file by the number of lines in the file unlike the :code:`ptc`
distribution that loads all lines and can use the :code:`matchDistrFileLength`.

.. note:: BDSIM must be compiled with GZIP. This is normally sourced from Geant4 and is
	  on by default.

.. _tunnel-geometry:

Tunnel Geometry
---------------

BDSIM can build a tunnel around the beam line. Currently, there are two main ways to control this.

1) The tunnel follows the beam line, bending automatically (recommended)
2) The tunnel is just built in a straight line - this may be useful for linear colliders but
   may also cause geometry overlaps (the user is responsible for checking this!)

.. warning:: With option 2, the user is entirely responsible to ensure no overlaps occur
	     (through good design). Also note that the samplers may overlap the tunnel
	     depending on the tunnel geometry (samplers are square with half-width of
	     `samplerRadius`). In practice, however, we haven't observed many ill effects
	     because of this. Problems would take the form of 'stuck particles' and
	     Geant4 would terminate that event.

Examples of tunnel geometry can be found with the BDSIM source code in */examples/features/geometry/tunnel*
and are described in :ref:`tunnel-examples`.

The soil around the tunnel is typically symmetric, with the `tunnelSoilThickness` being added to
the larger of the horizontal and vertical tunnel dimensions.

.. note:: Construction of the tunnel geometry may fail in particular cases of different beam lines.
	  Beam lines with very strong bends ( > 0.5 rad) over a few metres may cause overlapping
	  geometry. In future, it will be possible to override the automatic algorithm between
	  certain elements in the beamline, but for now such situations must be avoided.

.. _materials-and-atoms:
	  
Materials and Atoms
-------------------

All chemical elements are available in BDSIM as well as the Geant4 NIST database
of materials for use. Custom materials and can also be added via the parser. All materials
available in BDSIM can be found by executing BDSIM with the `-\\-materials` option.::

  bdsim --materials

Aside from these, several materials useful for accelerator applications are already defined
that are listed in :ref:`predefined-materials`.

Generally, each beam line element accepts an argument "material" that is the
material used for that element. It is used differently depending on the element. For example,
in the case of a magnet, it is used for the yoke and for a collimator for the collimator
block.

Single Element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of an element, the chemical symbol can be specified::

  rc1: rcol, l=0.6*m, xsize=1.2*cm, ysize=0.6*cm, material="W";

These are automatically prefixed with :code:`G4_` and retrieved from the NIST database of
materials.

The user can also define their own material and then refer to it by name when defining
a beam line element.

Custom Single Element Material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the material required is composed of a single element, but say of a different density or
state than the default NIST one provided, it can be defined using the **matdef**
command with the following syntax::

  materialname : matdef, Z=<int>, A=<double>, density=<double>, T=<double>, P=<double>, state=<char*>;

=========  ========================== =============
Parameter  Description                Default
Z          Atomic number
A          Mass number [g/mol]
density    Density in [g/cm3]
T          Temperature in [K]         300
P          Pressure [atm]             1
state      "solid", "liquid" or "gas" "solid"
=========  ========================== =============

Example::

  iron2 : matdef, Z=26, A=55.845, density=7.87;

A compound material can be specified in two manners:

Compound Material by Atoms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the number of atoms of each component in a material unit is known,
the following syntax can be used::

   <material> : matdef, density=<double>, T=<double>, P=<double>,
                state=<char*>, components=<[list<char*>]>,
                componentsWeights=<{list<int>}>;

================= ===================================================
Parameter         Description
density           Density in [g/cm3]
components        List of symbols for material components
componentsWeights Number of atoms for each component in material unit
================= ===================================================

Example::

  NbTi : matdef, density=5.6, T=4.0, components=["Nb","Ti"], componentsWeights={1,1};

Compound Material by Mass Fraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the other hand, if the mass fraction of each component is known, the
following syntax can be used::

   <material> : matdef, density=<double>, T=<double>, P=<double>,
                state=<char*>, components=<[list<char*>]>,
                componentsFractions=<{list<double>}>;

=================== ================================================
Parameter           Description
components          List of symbols for material components
componentsFractions Mass fraction of each component in material unit
=================== ================================================

Example::

  SmCo : matdef, density=8.4, T=300.0, components=["Sm","Co"], componentFractions = {0.338,0.662};

The second syntax can also be used to define materials which are composed by
other materials (and not by atoms).

.. note:: Square brackets are required for the list of element symbols, curly
	  brackets for the list of weights or fractions.

New elements can be defined with the **atom** keyword::

  elementname : atom, Z=<int>, A=<double>, symbol=<char*>;

=========  =====================
Parameter  Description
Z          Atomic number
A          Mass number [g/mol]
symbol     Atom symbol
=========  =====================

Example::

  myNiobium  : atom, symbol="myNb", Z=41, A=92.906;
  myTitanium : atom, symbol="myTi", Z=22, A=47.867;
  myNbTi     : matdef, density=5.6, T=4.0, components=["myNb","myTi"], componentsWeights={1,1};

Crystals
--------

To use various crystal components in BDSIM such as `crystalcol`_, a crystal definition
must first be made. This contains all of the required information to construct the
crystal. The following parameters are required:

+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Parameter**     | **Description**                                            |

+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| bendingAngleZAxis | Angle that the crystal is bent about Z-axis [rad].         |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

* (*) Note, the units of metres may seem ridiculous, but the parser is consistently in S.I.
  (or as much as possible). We recommend using units in the parser such as Angstroms.
  See :ref:`coordinates-and-units`.

.. note:: Depending on the shape chosen, the geometry may or may not represent the bending angle.
	  The `bendingAngleYAxis` is always supplied to the channelling physics process
	  irrespective of the geometry. This is important to note that the crystal may be a box,
	  but the 'crystal' inside (in terms of the physics process) is not related to the geometry
	  and is bent. The physical geometry is merely a volume where the crystal parameters
	  apply.

.. note:: If there is no vertical bending angle, the torus geometry will reduce to the
	  cylinder geometry,  as this is faster for tracking. Similarly, if the cylinder is used
	  and there is no horizontal bending angle, a box will be used, as it's not possible
	  to construct a cylinder with an infinite bending radius.

It is entirely possible to add more shapes to the code. Please contact the developers
:ref:`feature-request`.

Examples::

  lovelycrystal: crystal, material = "G4_Si",
	       		data = "data/Si220pl",
			shape = "box",
			lengthY = 5*cm,
			lengthX = 0.5*mm,
			lengthZ = 4*mm,
			sizeA = 5.43*ang,
			sizeB = 5.43*ang,
			sizeC = 5.43*ang,
			alpha = 1,
			beta  = 1,
			gamma = 1,
			spaceGroup = 227,
			bendingAngleYAxis = 0.1*rad,
			bendingAngleZAxis = 0;

  uglycrystal: crystal, material = "G4_Si",
	     	      	data = "data/Si220pl",

Regions
-------

In Geant4, it is possible to drive different *regions*- each with their own production cuts and user limits.
In BDSIM, there is one default region to which the options prodCutXXXX apply (see `Options`_) and then
the user may define additional regions and attach them to the objects desired.  For example::

  precisionRegion: cutsregion, prodCutProtons=1*m,
                               prodCutElectrons=10*m,
			       prodCutPositrons=10*m,
			       prodCutPhotons = 1*mm;

  d1: drift, l=10*m, region="precisionRegion";

.. _bend-tracking-behaviour:
	    
Bends
-----

Fringe Field Integral Behaviour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fringe fields can be specified for dipole magnets through the parameters `hgap`, `fint` and `fintx`.
`fint` is the fringe field integral, as described in :ref:`dipole-fringe-integrator` for the entrance
face of the dipole. `fintx` is for the same, but for the exit face. Even when there is no pole face
rotation, there is still a small fringe field effect.

If `fint` is specified but `fintx` is not, `fintx` will default to the same value as `fint`. If,
however, `fintx` is set to 0, it will in fact be 0 and will not take the value of `fint`. This is
the same default behaviour as MADX. MADX will write out a value of `fintx` as -1 in this case in
any output. BDSIM will write out the value used, even if it's equal to 0.

Pole Face Rotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `bdsimtwo` integrator set (see :ref:`integrator-sets`) provides tracking through a uniform
magnetic field in a dipole. The field exists wherever the magnet exists; in the case of pole
face rotations on the end of a dipole, the magnet is constructed with the appropriate angled face.
The field therefore also has a hard edge with exactly no field immediately outside the magnet volume.

The tracking routine for dipoles in the `bdsimtwo` integrator set (see :ref:`bdsim-dipole-rodrigues2`)
tracks the particle using the analytical helical solution in a pure magnetic field in Cartesian
coordinates. This however does not agree with the tracking provided by MADX. We therefore provide
an equivalent to MADX in `bdsimmatrix` integrator set (the default). The vertical focussing provided
by the fringe field is the same in both cases.

The difference between the two is negligible for small pole face angles - for example, the LHC lattice
shows no difference between the integrator sets (~14mrad bending angle and very low pole face angles).
However, with higher angle bends and stronger pole face angles (maximum is up to 45 degrees), the
difference is non-negligible.

The integrator for dipoles in `bdsimtwo` is computationally faster and should be used for lattices
like the LHC, where speed matters and the pole faces are not a strong feature.

.. note:: To provide equivalent tracking to MADX with the `bdsimmatrix` integrator set, the
	  magnet geometry is constructed with flat ends (i.e. always an sbend). Rbends are constructed
	  as sbends with additional poleface rotation angles equal to half the bend angle. Instead of
	  constructing the poleface geometry, the effect of a poleface rotation is applied in a thin
	  fringefield magnet (1 micron thick by default) at the beginning (for non-zero e1) or at the
	  end (for non-zero e2) of the dipole. In future, this will be decoupled to allow both the
	  physical angled faces in the model as well as accurate tracking, using the MADX style matrix
	  integrators.

Large Angle Bends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For a model that includes large angle bends (for example > 0.1rad), the user should consider reducing
the sampler diameter (see :ref:`sampler-dimensions` and :ref:`options-geometry`). This is because
the default 5m width of a sampler may cause overlaps between samplers, or each sampler may record
particles from multiple positions in the beam line.

One other point is that the parallel geometry used for curvilinear transforms (the "curvilinear world")
may overlap with other curvilinear elements earlier in the beam line. The size of the curvilinear
world `cylinders` is based on the samplerDiameter and reducing the samplerDiameter will reduce its size.
There is some automatic provision for this in BDSIM where the sampler diameter is automatically reduced
when large angle bends are present in the lattice, but this is based on a heuristic, rather than direct
overlap checks.

In short, we recommend running with :code:`option, checkOverlaps=1;` once to verify there are no
problems for a machine with large angle bends. If there are any overlaps, reduce the sampler diameter
to the typical full width of a magnet.

.. _colours:

Colours
-------

Most items allow you to define a custom colour for them to aid in visualisation. This includes
all magnets and collimators, the shield and degrader. The colour can be defined with red, green
and blue components, as well as a level of transparency, alpha. RGB values can range from 0
to 255. Once defined, a colour may not be redefined. The syntax to define a colour is

.. code-block:: none

		NAME: newcolour, red=#, green=#, blue=#, alpha=#

Examples::
  
  purple: newcolour, red=128, green=0, blue=128;
  col1: rcol, l=0.2*m, xsize=5*cm, ysize=4*cm, colour="purple", material="copper";


and::

  purple: newcolour, red=128, green=0, blue=128;
  orange: newcolour, red=255, green=140, blue=0;
  nicegreen: newcolour, red=0, green=128, blue=0;

  d1: drift, l=1*m;
  basebend: sbend, l=2*m, angle=0.9;
  sb1: basebend, colour="purple";
  sb3: basebend, colour="nicegreen";
  sb4: basebend, colour="yellow";
  sb5: basebend, colour="orange";
  sb6: basebend, colour="red";

  beamline: line=(d1,sb1,d1,basebend,d1,sb3,d1,sb4,d1,sb5,d1,sb6,d1);
  use, beamline;
  sample, all;

  beam,  particle="proton",
         energy= 50*GeV;

This examples if from `bdsim/examples/features/visualisation/coloured_sbend.gmad` and
produces the model shown below.

* Colours can only be specified on an element-by-element basis.
* Colour names are case-sensitive.
* New colour names must not clash with predefined BDSIM colour names.

All available colours in BDSIM can be found by running BDSIM with the `--colours` command::

  bdsim --colours

.. _controlling-simulation-speed:

Controlling Simulation Speed
----------------------------

The particle showers created in high energy particle interactions with matter can lead to a
very large number of particles being produced in an event. These in turn each take time to
track through the model and the computational time per event increases. When simulating a
very high-energy scale, the user may not be interested in very low-energy particles, however
these may dominate the simulation time.

To improve efficiency, there are several options the user can adjust. These however may reduce
the accuracy of the results obtained and must be used cautiously and only where required.

Range Cuts
^^^^^^^^^^

The production range cuts are the recommended method from Geant4, who strongly advocate
these over energy-based tracking cuts. These produce the most accurate results while
reducing simulation time. Approximately, these are the length a secondary must travel
before interacting. If the secondary would not travel further than this (depending on
the secondary species, physics lists, material and energy), the secondary will not
be produced. These can be set globally or for a *region* (see `Regions`_) that is attached
to individual volumes through the "region" parameter for that accelerator element. In
fact, a range cut always exists in Geant4 (to prevent infrared divergence) and is by
default 0.7 mm.
::

   rangecut=3*cm;
   option, prodCutPhotons   = rangecut,
           prodCutElectrons = rangecut,
           prodCutPositrons = rangecut,
           defaultRangeCut  = rangecut;

.. warning:: The range cut should **not** be longer than the typical dimension of the objects
	     (i.e. a range cut of 1 km is likely to produce very rough energy deposition
	     around boundaries).

Minimum Kinetic Energy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user may specify a minimum kinetic energy, below which any particle will be killed.
This may break conservation of energy if used aggressively. The default is 0 eV, as all
particles are tracked to zero energy (allowing for the above range cuts). ::

   option, minimumKineticEnergy=10*MeV;

.. warning:: This will affect the location of energy deposition - i.e. the curve of
	     energy deposition of a particle showering in a material will be different.

Minimum Range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user may specify a minimum range for a particle to travel. Any particles with step
sizes proposed below this will be killed. Again, this can break energy conservation
if used aggressively. ::

  option, minimumRange=2*cm;

.. warning:: This will affect the location of energy deposition - i.e. the curve of
	     energy deposition of a particle showering in a material will be different.

.. _multiple-beamlines:

Multiple Beam Lines
-------------------

BDSIM has the ability to use multiple beam lines.  This feature is still in development and
is currently only for visualisation purposes. Secondary beam lines are placed either with
respect to the world coordinate system or with respect to a particular element in the main
beam line. A few caveats:

* Only for visualisation purposes
* Beam lines cannot be placed with respect to an element in another secondary beam line.
* Secondary beam lines are not suitable for tracking.
* Secondary beam lines are not sensitive to energy deposition, nor do they produce output.
* The user is entirely responsible for overlapping geometry. The visualiser will render
  the geometry, but of course it will not be suitable for simulations, as overlaps lead
  to volume navigation problems and incorrect tracking.

The user may use any sequence defined in the parser before the `use` command. The secondary
beam line is produced by declaring a placement. The placement definition (see
:ref:`placements`) is augmented with the following parameters:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{5cm}|p{10cm}|

| **Parameter**          |  **Description**                                              |

This example is shown in bdsim/examples/features/geometry/10_multiple_beamlines.  It defines
a simple beam line and two other sequences that are placed alongside it. Further explanation
is given below the example.

   d2: drift, l=3*m;
   d3: drift, l=5*m;

   use, mainLine;

   beam, particle="e-",
         energy=3*GeV;

                             referenceElement = "d2" ,
			     referenceElementNumber = 2,
			     x = -5*cm,
			     z = -1*m,
			     axisAngle = 1,
			     axisY = 1,
			     angle = -0.2;

   auxLine2Place: placement, sequence = "auxLine2",
                             referenceElement = "d2",
			     referenceElementNumber = 2,
			     x = -10*cm,
			     z = -1*m,
			     axisAngle = 1,
			     axisY = 1,
			     angle = -0.5;

   auxLine3Place: placement, sequence = "auxLine3",
                             x = 1*m,

Firstly, a series of simple elements are defined (drifts, quadrupoles and bends). A simple
sequence called `fodo` is defined and also the main beam line, called `mainLine`. After this,
extra sequences are defined that we will use for secondary beam lines.  The `use` command
selects which beam line the simulation will be based on. ::

  use, mainLine;

After this, the beam is defined (required for any simulation for rigidity calculations),
then the placement of secondary beam lines.

The first placement `auxLine1Place` is a placement that will place the sequence named
`auxLine1` with respect to the third instance of the element `d2` in the primary sequence
(`mainLine`). ::

  auxLine1Place: placement, sequence="auxLine1",
                            referenceElement="d2" ,
			    referenceElementNumber=2,

The placement is generally with respect to the centre of the element described in the primary
beam line and along the direction it's pointing. Without any displacement, the geometry
would therefore overlap.  Here, an offset and rotation are specified for this particular placement.
An offset in `x` of -5 cm and -1 m in `z` is specified. The coordinate system is right-handed
with positive-z pointing along the direction of travel in the beam line. A negative-x
displacement is therefore to the right, looking along the direction of travel and 1 m in
`z` is towards the beginning of the element from the centre.  Rotations are described
in :ref:`placements`. Here, an axis angle rotation is used. The beam line is rotated about
the unit Y-axis (local to that element) by -0.2 rad.

The second placement uses a different sequence, but in a similar fashion.

The third placement doesn't specify a `referenceElement`, so the placement is with respect
to the beginning of the beam line.

The model is shown below.

The drift segments do not of course connect but are merely placed close to each other.
In future, continuous vacuum points will be provided.
