V1.2 - 2018 / 08 / ??
=====================

Highlights
----------

* :code:`outerDiameter` is now :code:`horizontalWidth` to better describe its function (backwards-compatible).
* Fixed dipole scaling with (the default) bdsimmatrix integrator set.

New Features
------------

* New options to activate extra models in em_extra physics list.
* New :code:`crystalcol` element for channelling crystals.
* New :code:`crystal` definition in parser.
* New "channelling" physics list for Geant4 crystal channelling physics process.
* Field maps need not be in `x`, `y`, `z`, `t` order and lower dimension fields (i.e. 1D or 2D) can
  be made for any dimension, i.e. it is now possible to specify a 1D field along the `z` direction.
* Rebdsim can now analyse a select range of events specifed by "EventStart" and "EventEnd" options.
  Issue #240.
* Placements can now be made with respect to S,x, and y in the main beam line, with respect to a beam line
  element and lastly in global Cartesian coordinates.
* Samplers will no longer be automatically attached (with :code:`sample, all;`) to dipoles with finite
  pole face rotations, as this may lead to tracking issues in Geant4. A developer option can force
  this on, although this is not recommended. Issue #241.
* `hkicker` and `vkicker` strength can be specified via the magnetic field :code:`B` instead of
  `hkick` or `vkick`.
* Support for dipole poleface curvature in tracking.
* Pole face rotations and fringe fields are now available for hkickers and vkickers, both thick and thin.
* New ability to specify the colour of any magnet and most elements through custom colour definition.
  
General
-------

* :code:`outerDiameter` is now :code:`horizontalWidth` to better describe its function
  (backwards-compatible). This naming was from a time when BDSIM could only create cylindrical
  magnets and beam pipes. Given it can now create more complicated geometry, this name is not
  a good choice and so has been renamed. BDSIM still supports the old syntax.
* :code:`vhratio` is now consistent with vkickers and refers to the vertical and horizontal ratio in
  the lab frame.
* The horizontal width of kickers is now taken from :code:`outerDiameter`. Previously, :code:`outerDiameter`
  corresponded to the height and :code:`vhratio` was really the horizontal-to-vertical ratio in
  the lab frame.
* Synchrotron radiation is disabled now with em_extra physics list (use dedicated
  synchrad physics list). Avoids double registration of physics process.
* New CMake variable ROOTSYS to allow easy specification of a specific ROOT installation.
* Visualisation of trajectories significantly faster (~10x) due to different strategy with Geant4
  visualisation system.
* "ang" unit is added to the parser for Angstroms.
* BDSIM will now exit if there is no space to make the necessary circular management objects
  (teleporter and terminator).
* long int used explicitly instead of int for event indices in analysis.
* Reimplemented primary first hit and last hit. Last hit is now the end point of the
  primary trajectory. No more linear memory usage with tracking time.
* Beam pipe extent calculation reimplemented and much less simplistic - used
  to check whether a pipe will fit inside a magnet.
* Mini-contents for syntax section of manual, as it's grown to a large size.
* New rmatrix element (experimental).
* EM Dissociation is now applicable up to 100 TeV.
* Significantly improved aperture shape checking for whether beam pipe will fit inside a magnet.
* BDSIM now recognises all elements by chemical abbreviation. These are found in the Geant4 NIST
  database by automatically prefixing the name with "G4\_". Issue #236.
* `circle` distribution z and t distributions are now reversed to be consistent with all other generators.
  These were T0 - dt and are now T0 + dt. Distribution will be different for the same seed as compared
  to a previous version of BDSIM.
* `square` distribution now calls random number generator for each coordinate every time for
  consistency. Distribution will be different for the same seed as compared
  to a previous version of BDSIM.

Output Changes
--------------

* New options for physics processes in em_extra.
* Options class (GMAD::optionsBase) number is incremented in output.
* New optional stepLength variable in Eloss part of Event Tree with option
  :code:`storeElossStepLength` to use this data.
* New optional preStepKineticEnergy in Eloss part of Event Tree with option
  :code:`storeElossPreStepKineticEnergy` to use this data.
* Energy Loss class (BDSOutputROOTEventLoss) number is increment in output.
* Tilt, offsetX, offsetY and material are added to the Model Tree output.
* Model class (BDSOutputROOTEventModel) number is incremented in output.
* Model information extended to provide everything necessary to make machine diagrams.
* New option :code:`storeModel` to turn off model storage in the output.
* Even Info class (BDSOutputROOTEventInfo) number is incremented in output.
* Event.Info now has a Boolean of whether the primary particle hit something or not.
* Samplers are **no longer** placed next to elements with angled faces when using the :code:`bdsimtwo`,
  :code:`geant4`, or :code:`geant4dp` integrator sets.
* Units are now written to the ASCII survey output for each column.
* New output class :code:`BDSOutputROOTEventCoords` to store coordinates for primary global coordinates.
* New branch called "PrimaryGlobal" in Event tree that stores the coordinates used with Geant4 in
  the global Cartesian frame.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed tracking bug where particle in very niche coordinates may reflect from a sampler
  at the end of a dipole with a very strongly angled pole face. #Issue 241.
* Fixed automatic tunnel building algorithm, which accumulated wrong variables, leading to
  problems when thin elements such as fringe fields or thin multipoles were included.
* Further improvements made to tunnel building algorithm for magnets with tilt. Issue #243.
* Fixed length check for very short elements. Small drifts would cause a crash from
  Geant4 due to invalid parameters - occurred as length check was wrong.
* Fixed non-positive definite warnings for no energy spread and time spread when using
  a Gaussian beam in a composite beam definition.
* Fixed Gauss beams used in composite distribution.
* Fixed the problem where no particles were being tracked when using a userfile bunch distribution with only one column.
* Fixed bug where last particle was missed from user bunch distribution file.
* Fixed corrupted example files for userfile bunch distribution. Issue #244.
* Fixed cutting planes in G4CutTubs constructor for tunnel in Geant up to Geant4.10.2.p02
  from too short tunnel section.
* Reimplemented the method of finding primary first and last hit so BDSIM doesn't need to
  save the whole trajectory for the primary. This fixes the behaviour of linearly growing
  unbounded memory usage when tracking for a long time in a ring. Issue #246, #242.
* Optical calculation now works for sub-relativistic positrons.
* ATF2 MADX output was not included in worked example as advertised - now included.
* Fixed scaling variable used when scaling a field map to a decapole magnet strength.
* Survey units for magnetic fields are now fixed from kT to T.
* Fixed issue where C-shaped vkickers and hkickers would ignore :code:`yokeOnInside`. Issue #251.
* Fixed possible overlap in vkicker, hkicker, and h-style dipole geometry with highly asymmetric
  beam pipes.
* Fixed incorrect report that beam pipe wouldn't fit in magnet for various aperture shapes. Issue #253.
* Fixed issue where the option :code:`writePrimaries = 0` would result in the hits for the first sampler
  being written to the primary sampler structure. Issue #245.
* Fixed lack of interaction with vacuum when processes biased - due to a specific Geant4 version.
  Issue #220.
* Fixed incorrect dipole scaling. Issue #239.
* Fixed E0 spread in `ring` beam distribution, which was finite in contrast to the description
  that it is always the central value.
* Fixed reproducibility for the `ring` distribution that didn't use the same random number generator
  as every other distribution. Coordinates will be different for this distribution for the same seed now.
* Fixed inconsistency of `t` and `z` coordinate in `square` beam distribution.
* `square` beam distiribution now varies with :code:`envelopeT`.
* Fixed S coordinate in output. Issues #247 and #248.

* New option in rebdsim to turn off histogram merging (for speed).
* Analysis classes have member names changed to match those in the output files, i.e. "eloss" is
  now "Eloss" in `bdsim/analysis/Event.hh`.
* Rebdsim is now tolerant of a missing '.' on the end of the Tree name (a ROOT subtlety).
* 'orbit' and 'optics' are now 'Orbit' and 'Optics' in the output.

  geometry with strong rotations.
